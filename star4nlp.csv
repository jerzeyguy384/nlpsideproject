1,La Jambe,/user_details?userid=X3Ki2Z6JTn9gbuz23NO3kg,"My friends and I were looking for a good happy hour spot to catch up at and having heard good things we ended up at La Jambe. La Jambe is a little French cafe with delicious wine. Wine during happy hour was $5 and the staff was great about catching us right before it ended to offer us a chance to grab more discounted drinks. Their happy hour wines also were good wines, none of the bottom shelf stuff you might get at other wine bars during happy hour.

We tried several white wines as well as the charcuterie and cheese plate, and split the La noisette and the la Boulanger. All were very tasty and made the perfect happy hour meal with wine.

The only disappointing thing I would say about this place is that my friend asked if they had wifi and they unfortunately didn't because I could see this being a great place to study during the day.

It is perfect for date night when you're looking to eat light or a glass of wine with your girlfriends on a Wednesday evening. The bar is relatively small, but with one wall lined with a floor to ceiling urban artwork, the vibe given off is trendy and French inspired. 

There menu is simple, but delicious. They have various cheese and meat options to build your own cheese plate (complete with accouterments like mustard and cornichons. The rest of the menu is mostly baguette sandwiches with DELICIOUS French bread.

The food is a bit pricey, but I really enjoyed my small charcuterie plate. The bar area is a beauty. There's a long bar counter that spans most of the space and some high-tops along the walls. It's probably best for 2-3 friends vs. a whole crew.

We arrived at 5:30 and it was pretty empty but towards the end of happy hour around 6:30, it was busy. Happy hour wines are a steal. You get a white, a red, and a rose for $5 and a sparkling for $6. Most places only offer wines on happy hour that are normally only $7-8  but the happy hour white here is normally priced at $13.

We also got a cheese board. They come in small, medium, and large. We got the small size for just under $20 and it was a decent size. It came with three cheeses (unfortunately one was blue- you cannot choose), a jam, candied vegetable, and a big basket of bread and crackers. They also offer gluten-free crackers free of charge.

11,La Jambe,/user_details?userid=FaGNAInxLWLeKRkcqpxILw,"Great food and service, but some of the prices are too high, and the interior is more Berlin than France and doesn't do it for me. 

I enjoyed several hours here Tuesday evening, first doing some work and then catching up with some friends. I arrived a few minutes after they opened for the evening, and I found a table along the wall to pull out some work to do while I sipped some red wine. They had a very enjoyable pinot noir on the happy hour menu, which I managed to enjoy two glasses of before stopping myself. I also snacked on some light bites, first the walnut pesto toast then the black olives. The toast had fantastic flavor, and was decently filling, especially for the small price. It's cool to think that you could come here and get a nice glass of wine and a decent snack for only $10 during happy hour. The olives were far superior to any black olives I've ever tasted before!

When my friends arrived we moved onto other wines and plates of meats and cheeses. The first one we tried was the La Surprise from the Plateaux Mixtes options. This rotates the cheeses and meets, and I can't remember the names of anything, just that it included some of the saucissons hanging by the bar, which were SO GOOD! I should have asked if they sell them to take home. Four of us split the medium size, and no one felt cut short. Still hungry, we ordered another round of drinks and tried one of the cheese plates, Le Caractère, which the server recommended based on my friend's preference for stronger cheeses. We also ordered the house made rillettes, which was pork that day. We ended up having to pay for another backer of bread, because despite ordering two dishes, they only gave us one basket of bread and crackers. Not a big deal for $2, but not right. The rillettes was delicious, and I don't like normal pâté. The cheese plate was also thoroughly enjoyed; we went with the medium portion again, and it all got consumed. The first plate was $34 and the second one was $24, which in the end struck me as around $6-8 too much for each (see photos). Still, the server was excellent!

The biggest issue for me is the space they chose--it's far too new and industrial for a French-themed wine bar. I've lived in France and visited many times, and it didn't at all transport me back there. What it did remind me of was Berlin, which has a lot of places with a rough, industrial feel, particularly because of the spray painted mural along the back wall. I can also easily tell that the building is new, which is very un-European. 

If I lived closer I'd probably come in from time to time, but the character of the space is too much of a downer for me to go out of my way again I think.

I know it's French inspired, but they could make it a bit more inviting for vegetarians and vegans. I ended up ordering a small cheese board, which tasted decent, but for a few pieces of cheese, definitely not worth the $16 dollars spent.

The only complaint I have is that their cheese boards are offered as a set grouping, and no modifications to the board can be made.  There were two options to choose from (each with three cheeses and some accompaniments), but they cannot make any substitutions if there happens to be a cheese or item you don't want, and you cannot order anything a la carte.

The Kitchen opens at 5PM I think and my friend got a grilled cheese and tomato soup that was really tasty. I ordered the hummus and it was also delicious. Our service was attentive and the bartenders took care of things. I'm not a huge wine-o but the Malbec I had was smooth and they seem to have a solid wine list. It's definitely a date spot, good for the Scandal lovers (I've heard they are avid wine drinkers) or anyone looking for a more relaxed U street experience. For sure worth checking out and added to my continually growing U street bar list.

We had the bruschetta, which was fresh and delicious; mozzarella balls with fresh chopped tomato/basil on top mini baguette toasts. Chad did a great job of creating our flights starting us off with Nals Margreid Pino Noir from Italy 2013. His second recommendation was the Familia Mayol Bonarda from Argentina 2013, my favorite; it was deep with a smoky flavor. And the last one was full bodied and floral (typically not used to describe reds)but that's what I tasted, Lantides Agiorgitiko from Greece 2013. The last one was a very specific flavor that may not go over well with everyone, but I enjoyed it and felt like it was best as a last selection.Although the pour is small, the wines are well selected with big distinctive flavor.

We also got a cheese board. They come in small, medium, and large. We got the small size for just under $20 and it was a decent size.

I enjoyed several hours here Tuesday evening, first doing some work and then catching up with some friends. I arrived a few minutes after they opened for the evening, and I found a table along the wall to pull out some work to do while I sipped some red wine. They had a very enjoyable pinot noir on the happy hour menu, which I managed to enjoy two glasses of before stopping myself. I also snacked on some light bites, first the walnut pesto toast then the black olives. The toast had fantastic flavor, and was decently filling, especially for the small price. It's cool to think that you could come here and get a nice glass of wine and a decent snack for only $10 during happy hour. The olives were far superior to any black olives I've ever tasted before!

When my friends arrived we moved onto other wines and plates of meats and cheeses. The first one we tried was the La Surprise from the Plateaux Mixtes options. This rotates the cheeses and meets, and I can't remember the names of anything, just that it included some of the saucissons hanging by the bar, which were SO GOOD! I should have asked if they sell them to take home. Four of us split the medium size, and no one felt cut short. Still hungry, we ordered another round of drinks and tried one of the cheese plates, Le Caractère, which the server recommended based on my friend's preference for stronger cheeses. We also ordered the house made rillettes, which was pork that day. We ended up having to pay for another backer of bread, because despite ordering two dishes, they only gave us one basket of bread and crackers. Not a big deal for $2, but not right. The rillettes was delicious, and I don't like normal pâté. The cheese plate was also thoroughly enjoyed; we went with the medium portion again, and it all got consumed. The first plate was $34 and the second one was $24, which in the end struck me as around $6-8 too much for each (see photos). Still, the server was excellent!

The biggest issue for me is the space they chose--it's far too new and industrial for a French-themed wine bar. I've lived in France and visited many times, and it didn't at all transport me back there. What it did remind me of was Berlin, which has a lot of places with a rough, industrial feel, particularly because of the spray painted mural along the back wall. I can also easily tell that the building is new, which is very un-European. 

If I lived closer I'd probably come in from time to time, but the character of the space is too much of a downer for me to go out of my way again I think.

And since this is Flight, they of course serve flights of wine with choices such as the Ottoman Empire (whites from Greece, Slovenia, and Georgia) and Austro-Hungarian Empire (a mix of white and rosés from the aforementioned countries).  

The glassware is short and boxy, and pours are available in half and full pours.  No cocktails, but they offer liquor and four draft beers with another nine beers and ciders in bottles and cans, including Stillwater Stateside Saison and Evolution Lucky No. 7 Porter.  The food menu is short and skews Italian (charcuterie, cheese, and sausage for apps, and linguine with sardines and wild boar oso buco for mains).

They even offer beers, ciders, spirits, apéritifs, and digestifs for non-wine lovers. 

I love the wine bar and the atmosphere. The gold-hued bar has a modern look to it, with a wooden wine shelf branching out into the ceiling. You can sit around the central half-circular bar or at one of the bar tables. Wines are poured into tumblers. The list of wines is quite extensive.

Each flight is priced at $18 making your choice solely based on what sounds good to you, which is refreshing.

They have a nice food menu where you can order a full meal or opt for an appetizer or cheese & charcuterie board. The cheese & charcuterie boards are beautiful, and they are generous with the portions! Something that I appreciate is that during happy hour they have both food and drinks for a deal. 

At flight they serve all the wine in what appear to be regular drinking glasses, with no stems. Our server explained that the owner found these glasses in Spain when they were wine tasting and enjoyed drinking out of them better. It doesn't bother me, but if you insist on a glass with a stem you can request one (maybe with a frown or smirk from the server).

Flight offered a July 4th rooftop party, all you eat and all you can drink for 95$ a person. This was my first time spending July 4th in DC, as I just moved here I didn't really feel like battling the mall, and wanted a nice night with my bf who was in town visiting. 

When we arrived, we were greeted in the lobby by a host and guided to the rooftop. She was extremely nice, as was every single member of the staff. They were all just so friendly, despite working the holiday. Flight is a family run operation, which makes it even more enjoyable. 

When we got to the rooftop, the bar was already open with tons of wine. Sparkling, reds, whites, blushes. Wine for days.  We had a nice table, with a good view. When the buffet opened, we got right in line. The food was very good. The braised short ribs were extremely tender. Chicken skewers were a little dry, but understandable for the quantity made and that they were sitting out. My only complaint on the buffet was that the salad was brought out so much later than everything else, so I didn't get any of it because I was so full. As for the appetizers passed around, the burger sliders were delicious. I don't like blue cheese, but they were perfect. The deviled eggs were good too. My only suggestion for the appetizers would be to have tooth picks or tongs for the eggs, so they aren't getting touched by everyone. 

When the fireworks started, the building in front of us blocked our view. We could see the tops of the fireworks, which was good enough for me. If a perfect view of fireworks is what you're after, this may not be for you- go battle the mall. But if you want a relaxing night, sipping wine, eating great food, and being surrounding by happy people, check out Flight (I hear they do New Year's Eve too).

It's not uncommon but it's a place two blocks from Verizon Center ( I would think  it would be busy on any given night due to the amount of events that take place and the crowd that area pulls) so most restaurants should be well prepared for that ... Or at least let us know ahead of time that they are out of something so we don't wait to place  our order thinking we will get to eat that dish. I won't dwell too much on that considering it was a Monday night and it does happen. Also, the duck sliders were good. Warning: the fries are delicious but super salty. 
We actually did not choose to do a flight because we were in a time crunch but the South African red we ordered was great and the bottle was affordable. I was pleasantly surprised with the bottle prices (ours was around $30).

Plus, a really visually cool bar area. Add those things to the company of a good friend, and I have myself a fantastic night! 
We were able to get some of the few remaining bar seats and right away a bartender brought over water and menus for us to look at. The flight list has so many great and interesting options that it was hard to choose! We must have spent a solid fifteen minutes just reading through all the options and descriptions. I believe my friend ordered the New World Whites, and I chose the Star Spangled Banner collection of domestic wines. The Viognier was fruity but not too sweet, the Pinot Noir was so smooth and the Syrah blend was bold! I really enjoyed the wide range they managed to fit into three glasses. And I appreciated the little cards detailing the specifics of each wine so we didn't have to keep going back to the menu. 
We also ordered a couple selections of the charcuterie. The prosciutto, another meat and the Caciocavallo cheese, which literally translates to Cheese Horse, so, how could we not choose that one, you know?
We ended up not eating here because it seemed pretty pricey. But other than that, the only minus I would give flight is that I think it's weird to serve the wine in those bodega glasses. I don't really know why I feel that way, it's just not my favorite.

Came on a Monday and it was nice and quiet at the bar. They have happy hour specials til 7. Nothing terribly exciting deal wise, but they offer some wines they normally don't have by the glass.

Bar staff are welcoming while being very nice and low key - no super salesy spiels or over friendliness. Just calm, efficient, knowledgeable people who are happy to answer questions, make recommendations, and provide little tastes of the wines if you're totally lost or just completely indecisive. The wine list is extensive and interesting, and I really liked that they seem pretty into Greek wines, which are harder to find in bars and restaurants. I greedily wish even more of the wines were available by the glass, but the good news is that everything available by the glass you can get the mini pour to make a flight of your own. In addition, they've got a few prepared flights like sparkling, red, rose, etc. that rotate through and are $18 for three half glasses. So many options, so little time.

The best surprise was the food. My friends ordered the $7 bread baskets expecting pretty small portions, but it's a real bread basket, that could easily be shared between three people with regular bread appetites, two people if you want to split it as an appetizer type thing, or a very filling carbo load for one. My pulled duck sandwich was fantastic, with tender duck, delicious slaw that featured ginger which really helped balance the richness of the duck, and a mountain of unusually, but strangely satisfyingly chewy fries (maybe because they're fermented??) that came with a nice aioli. And at $16, that seems entirely reasonable for a wine bar.

In addition to the comfortable round bar, there are several small tables and a couple of bigger ones around the room where you can get nice and settled in.

If you are expecting to get a large selection of food choices, you are going to the wrong place. The wine menu is bigger than the food menu (which should be expected since it's a wine bar). 

The food selection was nothing to brag about. I cannot say that I had a particularly memorable dish. However, I really enjoyed my Flights selection. I loved how they categorized their flights, and provided in depth descriptions of each. I chose the ""Hipster and proud of it"" flight. I am a fan of red wines, so I thoroughly enjoyed this selection. It was a decent size for the price ($18 for three).  Another highlight was getting discounted bottles for happy hour. I cannot recall if they were 1/2 off, but it was definitely a good deal. Instead of getting a birthday cupcake/dessert, I got a free full sized glass of wine.

The building is old and the interior is actually visually interesting.

Seriously, it was up there at the top of best duck prosciutto's I've tried.  The cheese board was also very good, the soft goat cheese with ash rind was my favorite.

For dessert, we had the crepas salguero - crepes filled with whipped cream and dulce de leche, and topped with chocolate sauce and cinnamon ice cream. It was very sweet, but very good.

Service was very friendly. They were quick to replenish our mimosas.

The moment you step through their doors, you are taken into a rustic, home-like world - away from the hustle and bustle of DC. If you decide to eat outside, you are seated under heated tables and welcomed with fluffy blankets. There's also an outdoor fireplace to add onto the cozy atmosphere. 

Food wise, don't expect to feel full when you leave this place without taking a hit from your wallet. The tapas portion sizes here are tiny but they don't taint the quality of the food that you get. You know you are getting the best cuts of meat and the best of the best when you order here. But this is a difficult place to eat on a budget simply because you want to try everything! Also remember that you are paying for service here. The waiters here are very accommodating and are quick to refill waters, bread baskets, and most importantly your wine glass! And if you decide to get wine here (which you should! Because Barcelona wine bar...) do yourself a favor and get a pitcher of sangria to share with your table. Your taste buds and wallet will thank you. :) 

I'll definitely be coming back here after a pay day to splurge a bit. This is for sure a feel good restaurant and would recommend trying at least once! Even if it's for the ambiance. It truly is an experience.

I arrived and thought there was a front door... oops!  I had to walk up the ramp and pass by all of the outside tables to get inside.  Once I did, I could see that the bar was already getting full.  I heard the happy hour only applied to the bar itself, but I saw a bunch of high tables around it.  So, I asked if my friends and I could claim one of those tables and take advantage of the happy hour, and it was a go!  

I ordered pitchers knowing everyone was going to want some sangria.  I got the red seasonal flavor, and it was quite delicious.  By the time my party of four was complete, I realized that we got a LOT of full glasses out of one pitcher.  We ended up ordering a second pitcher before 6:00, and we were definitely more than satisfied.  They were only $20, such a great deal.

I ordered the ham croquettes for food, and I wish I had an entire platter of those things, WHEW!  They were really, really tasty.

Seriously any occasion this place is perfect. The bar, outside and dining area are so cute! It gets packed and booked up. Be sure to book far in advanced. The servers are always so friendly!

My only issue is that one time I had a reservation for 8 people. Three of them being men. They put us at the worlds smallest table. I thought they were kidding. Our elbows were touching and we had no room for plates and our entrees. We put in a request to be moved but they were so busy we couldn't be moved. My advice is just be aware of where you seat people. 

Below are my favorites that I always order:
 
Meatballs - taste homemade and oh so good! There's plenty of sauce to scoop up with the bread they give you. 

Hanger Steak - always tasty! Sometimes it varies on how it is cooked but more than likely it's always medium rare. They recently did a new sauce with it, a truffle vinaigrette. It's good, I don't taste a strong presence of truffle though. But the steak is delicious. 

Patatas Bravas - a good starch if you need to add one to your order. So so good! They are diced up little potatoes and are drizzled with a garlic aioli and salsa. I will say they tend to always skimp on the sauces. I always order an extra side of it. It never costs extra. 

The skate dish - I don't remember what it is called. It's a fish in this light sauce. It's so good, get it!

Some brunch items 
Shrimp and grits - very tasty. Decent sized shrimp. Only issue is that a lot of the grits were stuck to the skillet. 

Egg Benedict with ham. Not impressed. It came out lukewarm and the bread was hard as rock. The ham was like deli ham. Won't order again. 

White sangria - SO tasty!! Only $26 for a huge pitcher!

This is a Spanish restaurant that has a rustic flair to it and has a relaxed style. It has plenty of outdoor seating and a full bar with more than enough fine wine options that will satisfy the interests you hold.

Where Is It?

Barcelona 14th Street is on 1622 14th Street NW in Washington. It opens at 4pm on most days and will stay open until 2am except on Sunday and Mondays when it is open until midnight. It also opens at 11am on weekends and 2pm on Thursdays.

It is best to contact the restaurant for reservations beforehand as this place is rather popular. You can call 202-588-5500 to get reservations.

A Beautiful Space

The rustic décor around Barcelona 14th Street creates a real Spanish vibe that adds to the class. This also has a wide open space with enough natural light coming in all around the place to create a classic feel. The outdoor dining area is especially enjoyable.

The noise level is relatively light as this is not too crowded or packed. This should be good enough for most people who want to enjoy a nice trip out.

What Is the Food Like?

The foods here are made with a variety of great Spanish influences. The hand-sliced Jamon Mangalica is prepared by being roasted for hours on end to create a dense and brilliant flavor. Meanwhile, the Patatas Bravas make for a great starter as these potatoes are cut up well and covered with plenty of sauce.

The Jamon and Chicken Croquettes mix enough of these two meats together in a series of small fried spots. This adds a good flavor that will certainly mix in well when enjoying a good meal. The Montadito and Paella Mariscos adds a fine mix of bread and vegetables together into one simple starter. Overall, the foods offered here are highly detailed and offer plenty of tastes for all people to look forward to enjoying.

What About the Bar?

The full bar at the restaurant is particularly extensive. This place has dozens of wines by the glass with a strong emphasis on wines from Spain and South America. The extended wine list covers all sorts of styles to fit everyone's taste.

The full bar also features many other cocktails and mixed drinks. Everything is prepared in a light and airy space to create an inviting experience all patrons are bound to remember.

You will enjoy dining at Barcelona 14th Street if you are looking for a great experience that features plenty of fine wine. I was particularly fond of how this place works hard to create some detailed and fresh meals. I feel that you will enjoy this place just as well when it comes to finding a spot that has nothing but the finest choices for you to have when looking for good Spanish food and some wine to accompany it.

While yes, it is a trendy wine bar chain that I wouldn't normally be inclined to visit, I had the loveliest experience having a late lunch there last Thursday. 

Since Barcelona isn't open for lunch until 2pm (why so late?! Is this an homage to the Spanish siesta?), my coworkers and I patiently and hangrily waited for them to open, even Uber-ing all the way to Logan Circle from Chinatown since a coworker mentioned that the patatas bravas were a ""religious experience"" to be had. We were the first - and seemingly only - group of customers at Barcelona during our leisurely lunch there from 2pm to 4pm. 

Omg, the service was amazing. The waiter offered us several samples of the sangria flavors and was generally bae. Nonetheless, we instead opted to split a couple bottles of the Tempranillo, which was very reasonably priced and delicious.

After getting started on the bread basket, we ordered a cheese plate, hanger steak, lamb pintxo, patatas bravas, beef empanadas and a vegetable paella (note that the paella takes about 30 minutes or so to come out, in case you're in a rush). The waiter felt so badly that the hanger steak took awhile to come out, so he brought us an extra serving to be nice! What a bae! It's hard for me to remember my favorite dish since I was drinking quite a bit and having a chatty time, but everything was great, and I do agree with my coworker that the patatas bravas were a religious experience.

We didn't order dessert, but the waiter brought us a complimentary platter full of various desserts, like flan and ice cream. WHAT?! This is probably the best service and most free stuff I have ever received at a meal. I don't know if it's because Barcelona was empty on this Thursday afternoon, or because the waiter was feeling generous -- but I loved it.

We tried a variety of tapas, including the potato tortilla, kale salad, beef empanadas, albondigas, and hanger steak with black truffle sauce.  While, all the dishes were good, we both agreeed that the albondigas (meatballs in a ham and tomato sauce) were the standout.  The meat was  juicy and flavorful.  The sauce was absolutely addicting!  It had a touch too much salt, but the flavors were so good, I barely noticed.  

The biggest disappointment in terms of the food was the paella.  We ordered the ""3 sausages"" paella and it was mediocre at best.  It didn't have a very rich flavor and was almost more like a pilaf than a paella.  

The service here was good.  The waiter was friendly and reasonably attentive considering how busy they were.  The only thing is that my fiancé asked for something to take care of a wine stain.  The waiter said he would bring some club soda, but never did.  Not a huge deal, but worth noting.  

One frustrating thing was that when I called to make a reservation the first time, it was so loud in the restaurant and the guy who answered the phone was REALLY discombobulated.  He kept yelling that he couldn't hear me (I was practically screaming at the top of lungs at this point) and almost hung up without asking me what time I wanted the reservation for.

We had a large party that Barcelona managed with ease. I heard that dining here can be frustrating because the servers will not rush any table (aka your reservation will wait as long as it takes for previous diners to leave). I can't say I experienced this in any way, since our party was seated with drinks and warm bread when i arrived a few minutes late.

Our wine and water glasses never dipped and each time I turned around, another plate was on its way over. For $35 each we got a sampling of just about every tapas plate on the menu. Some highlights for me were the steak, lavender honey toast, spicy broccolini, and butternut squash with yogurt sauce. It was a lot of fun drinking out of the carafe to close out our meal, and I am contemplating heading back there tonight just for the decadent brownie sundae.

We stopped by this location recently for some tapas and had a fantastic meal. The food was delicious and I was very impressed by the speed that the food was delivered. Pretty much five minutes after our order was placed, the tapas began arriving one by one and everything was at the table within three minutes. Before the tapas arrived, we also received some warm crispy bread served with olive oil.

I loved all four tapas that we tried, which included:

- Hanger Steak: My favorite dish. The meat was very juicy and tender and seasoned well. It was prepared exactly how I requested (medium) and charred to perfection.
- Salmon a la Plancha: Sooo good! Literally melted in my mouth and was very moist and tender. The salmon had a very nice sear on top and was crispy on the outside.
- Gambas al Ajillo: This was only ok. I felt that the portion was a bit small since there were only five shrimps. The sauce was very buttery and I expected more garlic.
- Mushrooms a la Plancha: The mushrooms were grilled very nicely and the salsa verde was yummy.

As a first timer, I really enjoyed my dining experience at Barcelona Wine Bar. The ambiance is cozy yet lively, and the music selection was great as well. Although it is a bit pricey, I look forward to returning for more tapas and to try their paella!

To be honest, I'd much rather come here on an ""off"" night. (And by ""off"" keep in mind that it's never really ""off."" Just less crowded on a Sunday, Monday or maybe even Tuesday night.) It's much easier to find seating around the bar, settle in and relax. On the other nights, it can become so packed that it's a little overwhelming so I'd prefer to skip altogether on the weekend.

It's an inviting, green, unique oasis that makes you want to drink Sangria and eat olives and cheese all day long. Nothing wrong with that. The atmosphere is really lovely and transports you out of the city for a short period of time. 

A friend and I recently went to this location around 5:45 on a Thursday and were able to sit on the patio immediately. It started to fill up around 6:15/6:30. Bread and olive oil are complimentary. 

We ordered a pitcher of the traditional sangria ($26) and started with the caña de cabra a la plancha which is a grilled, soft cheese drizzled with honey and nuts. For two people, a whole cheese plate can be too ambitious, so this is a great starting option. Then we moved onto cheese and ham croquettes and a tortilla. The croquettes are an all star order. Highly recommend. The tortilla is average in comparison to other things. Then we tried the scallops, broccolini, and meatballs. The scallops served with a light salsa verde were my favorite and the meatballs in a spiced red sauce were a hit with my friend. We made it out spending only about $40. And that my friends is a win.

710,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=xHFxpKyrCBpZza39GeCcJw,"A large group of us came here this weekend for a bachelorette party dinner and we elected to do the $45 tasting menu. They gave us more food than I could ever imagine eating and we thoroughly enjoyed most of it. The garbanzo bean dish (not sure exactly what it was called) was to die for, the cheese charcuterie and another soft cheese and grilled bread dish was very good as well. Yummy olives and bread and olive oil to start. The duck breast and the truffled hangar steak were also quite delicious. For drinks we had a pitcher of red sangria and really enjoyed it. Great service and the food kept coming quickly all night long. I was a bit disappointed with the brussels sprouts as they were rather oily and not that flavorful. Finally, for dessert, the sorbets and the chocolate lava cake were delicious. Also interesting to note is the fact that you can sit outside all year long as they have blankets and heaters available. Overall, good experience here.

The Brussels sprouts gratin were all right and I enjoyed the patatas bravas as I usually do.  It would have been nice to try the spiced beef empanadas which we ordered but instead we didn't get what we ordered and ended up trying a room-temperature mix of peppers and eggplant which was overly salty and spicy.  The hanger steak with truffle vinaigrette was delicious but it would have been nice if there was a larger quantity served in an order.  We also tried the sangria rose which was nice, but it was really the seasonal caipi Porto with limes, oranges and pomegranates and the Basque in the sun with basque cider, lemon, and strawberry that were excellent!  At first I thought the churros y chocolate were covered with granulated sugar but they weren't overly sweet and were nice with the chocolate dipping sauce.

Expecting us to wait, I understand, it's Friday night but I shouldn't have to force you for an update on our table. The duration of waiting can be excruciating when you're standing up in heels, watching everyone else eating and drinking. One of the managers offered us a round of sangrias, I assume after he saw the looks on our faces. 
We were finally seated outside by the fireplace and heat lamps- great ambiance and the blankets at our table were a nice surprise.

Additionally, many notables such as John Quincy Adams, Yul Brynner, Leon Spinks, and Lil Kim were born on 7/11, but more importantly it's MY birthday.

My dining companion made reservations which are essential for this DC hot spot. There were multiple parties of 2 walking in asking how long the wait is, and shocked when the front desk attendants responded ""two hours"".  We checked in and were seated without delay. Despite the restaurant being almost filled to capacity, the staff treated us like VIPs. I was wondering if my friend slipped them a few dollars.  

Our server explained the menu with finesse using colorful adjectives to arouse interest then delivered our bread basket with olive oil. We ordered white sangria and multiple tapas including watermelon salad, crispy calamari, patatas bravas, and grilled hangar steak.

I'm giving this place 4 stars, not because it's a Mecca of fine dining but because it does what it does well.  The food is honest and not frou-frou.  The prices are reasonable for the quality and care of the food, and the ambience is gemütlichkeit/cool.  

The service is friendly and accommodating.  Not super professional, but I'll take it over professional and unfriendly.

We started with the acorn-fed pig shoulder, which was good but I wouldn't necessarily splurge to have it again.  Cured hams can be fickle.

Then we had the rib eye steak which was solid and the roasted asparagus which were done to perfection.  The pork belly was good but short of great.  Then we had the squid with noodles dish which was delicious.

729,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=GVndi89uk-TbrnKApqj0gw,"I went to Barcelona this weekend for brunch. The restaurant itself is very nice, elegant, great decor, definitely a very nice space. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and our table was ready pretty quickly. Our waitress explained the menu to us, told us about the bloody mary bar, and took our drink orders. Food wise, everything we tried was delicious! We all shared, ya know, tapas and whatnot, we had: 

- avocado salmon toast - pretty good, but must admit, looked better on yelp pics 
- fideos - delicious! waitress described it as a ""pasta dish"" which I suppose isn't incorrect per se, but when she says pasta dish twice you picture, you know, a legit PASTA dish. Well, fideos are very very thin noodles, the type you make chicken soup with, ya know? They hardly count as pasta, IMO. It's not a heavy dish at all, but she made it sound that way. Anyway, it was delicious. Had we known HOW delicious, woulda ordered two (they take 20ish minutes to make, so not something you can add mid-meal, sadly). 
- patatas bravas - standard, very good 
- other potatoes with peppers - meh, woulda rather had 2 orders of the bravas 
- salmon egg benedict (single) - tasty, the little toast it sits on (not an english muffin) is delicious and crispy
- morcilla (blood sausage) egg benedict - didn't try, but hubs said delish 
- a board of sobrasada, a pork sausage and goat cheese - all very good, came with a bit of quince 
- bread - their bread is ahhhhhmazing! it comes out warm, pre sliced, and wow, it's fantastic. Only downside is we had to keep asking the waitress/runner/whoever for more (we were 5 and one serving was enough for one slice p/person, so naturally, we needed a few refills). 
- to drink we had a pitcher of the red sangria: I really liked it but opinions were quite varied on this drink. The color was purple, I felt like I was drinking grape juice, but the taste, for me, was perfect. sidenote: the waitress offered to keep the pitcher at their stand because our table was jam-packed with tapas/plates/the board/glasses, which was nice, however, I had to get up twice to get the pitcher and pour everyone refills. If you're going to offer to keep the pitcher at your stand, you should glance our glasses as it is now your job to refill them, no? This was annoying. 

Overall the food was great, the service sub par. This seems to be the case at a lot of restos that are frankly too expensive for this to be the norm. Hope this changes, because it doesn't leave a great taste in your mouth. However, 4 stars because, duh, the food! and the ambiance! 

p.s. their brunch menu listed online is very outdated, half the things we ate aren't listed on it, and half the things listed on it are not currently available at the restaurant. They need to update. Annoying when browsing it to jog my memory of what we ordered, and I find a totally different menu!!! They have actual brunch entrees on the one listed online, but in person, it's all tapas!!

740,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=B74FxYnPln4UBucLhOnNdQ,"Big props for customer service here. Somehow our Saturday night reservation for 4 people at peak hour was arranged for the other location, so when we showed up and the hostess couldn't find our reservation, the manager was quick to step in and save the day, getting us seated with no wait. Albeit we had to sit outside, but the wait was over two hours long to get a table, so that was way beyond what I expected. They could have easily told us to GTFO #sorrynotsorry, but they didn't, and they were really accommodating. And on top of that, when making the original ressies, a favor was pulled to get the corking fee waved, and these guys even honored that without blinking an eye.

When it came to ordering we just went for a diverse plethora of tapas to share. I also ordered a spring mix salad with butternut squash, pomegranate and walnuts, while the others got a seafood pallea to split. For the tapas, we got: cauliflower, brussle sprouts, shrimp, potatoes, clams, a side of bread and churros for dessert. Everything was delicious. I think my personal favorite was the brussle sprouts. They were crispy and flavorful and the serving was a good, shareable size. Unlike the cauliflower, which was also delicious, but I think there were less than 10 florets on the plate. The potatoes were also super yummy. I even tried a clam, which I don't typically eat, and it was definitely tasty. The churros which were served in a portion of 4, were accompanied by a spicy chocolate dipping sauce. SO Good. And my salad -- delicious. Everything we ate was great. The only downside of sitting on the patio, aside from the obvious of being outside in the middle of winter, was the extreme smoke. They have a wood burning fire place on the patio, supplying warmth and an intimate ambiance, but also, a pungent smokey scent that I can still smell on me, 3 days an 4 showers later.  And it really burnt my eyes, so that was less than enjoyable. Also, I know the waiter didn't know this, but I brought the wine, yet he gave the men the taster glass before the pour. Damn gender roles! I shake my fist at you! For four people to be fully fed, it came to around $130 bucks.

I went here last Friday with 6 of my Gourmand buddies and we all shared various tapas dishes and the wonderful seafood paella. So even with this one visit, I can judge pretty fairly how the restaurant is, I think.
I made the reservation way ahead of time by phone, and i'm glad I did. The place was packed when I arrived at 6:35pm. But they did have a small round table with 7 chairs in the middle of the main dining room for us. Luckily, we all could sit around the round table snugly. We actually liked this round table. We were all able to talk, hear and see everyone easier than when sitting at a rectangular shaped table.
The gratis bread was served nice and warm and tastes very good.
Marinated Olives, Spicy Eggplant Caponata, Jamon Serrano, Blistered Cherry Tomatoes, Hanger Steak, Grilled Iberian Pig Shoulder, were all very good.
Paella Mariscos (seafood paella) was EXCELLENT!
Hamachi Tartar was okay. It had too much saucy coating and the subtle natural flavor was lost in there. White Sangria was beautiful but I want to taste more wine in there.

749,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=6JGtjjm6ypKqSgc04Q_IkQ,"Last Sunday night, my boyfriend and a friend went to Barcelona for dinner. We arrived around 6:30pm and were told the wait wouldn't be that long. We had prepared ourselves for a long wait and despite what they told us, it did take about an hour and a half to get a table. At some points there were a few tables on the patio that were empty and not being seated, which was confusing, but I know their system is to take half reservations and half walk-ins.

We had an enjoyable wait at the bar and ordered a variety of wine, beer, and cocktails. The place was slammed, but the service was great. I really enjoyed the Summer St. Sling, which was refreshing and fruity. The wine list was really good as well, and we enjoyed a couple of glasses before being seated. There finally was a table ready, and at that point, we were all starving. If you are going to walk in, be prepared for a wait regardless of what they tell you.

We were seated at a nice table out on the patio, which has great ambiance and is perfect for dinner with friends or a romantic date night. We started out by ordering a bottle of wine that was priced at $22, which wasn't bad at all. The tapas style menu is expansive and has a little something for everyone. The server recommended that we order three dishes per person, so about nine dishes for our party.

We started with a meat and cheese chef's selection but we totally disappointed because they were out of the jamon serrano. We ended up with anchovies, a chorizo, olives, and  romoa. We continued with the jamon and chicken croquettas, which were amazing! We also got the patatas bravas, morcilla, calamari, hanger steak, and some kind of pork dish. The standout for me was the croquettas, calamari, and the pork dish. They accidentally served up two morcillas, and we were honest in letting them know, but they took it back. It had been sitting on our table for at least ten minutes, so I'm not sure what they planned on doing with it. The pork didn't arrive until we asked about it, so it was served to us after we had been waiting for about twenty minutes after the rest of the dishes were already gone. 

We ended the meal with churros, which were everything you want churros to be and more. My friend had requested a side of dulce de leche with them; however, we had to wait for a while before they brought it out. When we received the bill, we found that we were charged $38 for a bottle of wine from the same wineries and the same varietal that we had ordered. When it was brought to the attention of the server, she checked with the manager, and then explained that since we drank it, we needed to pay for it, even though they mistakenly brought out the bottle of wine. We no longer had the wine list when the bottle arrived at our table to ensure that it indeed was the bottle of wine we ordered. I was frustrated by this, but the server did provide two drink tokens for the next visit as compensation. I don't think this was the best way to have handled their mistake, but my boyfriend, who paid the bill, was satisfied by it.

They have a very high volume of customers, which accounts for most of the errors in service, so they are somewhat more excusable. All in all, I enjoyed my meal at Barcelona.

The reason for the one star drop was due to the service.

There are some caveats, and I'm sure to make things worse by telling everyone, but the place is SUPER crowded. Maybe it's because I came on a Friday night around 8:30PM? Regardless, it took us close to 2 hours to get a table. I overheard that there were girls who had a party of 6 who made a reservation, and kept calling to confirm that the reservation was still holding, but by the time she and her friends got here (on time I assume), the table still wasn't ready so they had to wait at least 30 more minutes.

However, the drinks were super delicious (sangria, anything with bourbon or whiskey) and the food was also really well done. We were seated outside with heat lamps (why is it still so cold in April?!) and blankets. A guy came around with a decanter of some sort with a spout, and was pouring wine into people's mouths at the table next to us, and of course we wanted to get into that action as well!

The bar seats are on first come, first served basis, so we were lucky that someone was leaving as we were arriving. 

Apparently, Monday is half-price wine night, and most of the wines of the list are included. We ended up splurging for some really good wine. I will say that Barcelona has had a good wine program both times I have been there. The sommelier matched the wine to what we were having that night and wanted to drink, so kudos to that.

My friend and I tried not to overdo it with the food. Tapas places like this, you end up ordering a lot of things and spending triple what you expected to spend. We kept it simple after starting with wine, and then I got lamb burger with a salad instead of bread. The salad was just mediocre. My friend both got the skirt steak dish, and for the price point, I thought that the portion was rather small.

Myself and two my other friends stopped by Barcelona to try out their well known tapas. Upon seeing the menu we were all overwhelmed with the many options they have. I honestly wanted to just order one of their brunch items and call it a day. But luckily my friends convinced me out of it and we all ended up ordering various tapas and ended up trying every dish. We initially ordered 10 items but 2 of them never came out (Thank god), we were all stuffed by the time all 8 items came out. I will try my best to list all the things we ate. 

Potato tortilla, spinach-chickpea cazeula, grilled hanger steak, spiced beef empanadas, patatas bravas, and I honestly can't seem to recognize the two other items looking at the menu now. The items my friends ordered are slipping my mind now. However, I can say all of the items tasted excellent. We went very carb-heavy with potatoes and ended up filling ourselves very quickly. I was under the impression that we were going to still be hungry afterwards but I was very wrong. The portions here for their tapas are larger then most other places. Even though I was suffering from food coma, I remember one thing very clearly the best dish was the grilled hanger steak. Being the most expensive item on their brunch tapas menu it was cooked to perfection. The steak pieces were cooked to medium rare and topped with truffle oil, SO DELICIOUS! it comes with seven pieces and were quickly consumed at our table. 

The service here was good and the restaurant had a very rustic ambiance and a large floor space with lots of light shining through their large windows. Being our first time at Barcelona, our waiter was very helpful. At the end of the meal, my friends and I decided this place warranted a second visit to try out their other tapas. Initially I ordered the spicy eggplant and since I never got that dish I really want to try it. My recommendation to all you out there, if your going for brunch one thing you must order is their hanger steak, actually make that 2 orders it's that good. Looking for tasty tapas in DC, you have found it!

There is outdoor seating available, which is great. As we sat down, we noticed the top notch service that other Yelpers have raved about. The waiter was super friendly. There was a lady who kept checking on us and if everything was going good. We ordered a pitcher of Sangria that we didnt like, and the waiter took it off and recommended other drinks. Overall, awesome service.

Now I had checked out the menu online before going for dinner. Looks like they change their menu often, so I couldnt get the Spiced Chickpea Fritters that I was looking forward to.  So there is so set standard menu, but enough vegetarian options.

I ordered the following:
- Patatas Bravas: DELICIOUS!!! I ordered two orders of these. The potatoes are flavorful and perfectly spiced.
- Spinach-Chickpea Cazuela: This is really good too. You eat it with the bread they serve you on the table. I wish it was more spicy, but overall worth trying.
- Spicy Eggplant Caponata: This was not on the menu yesterday. When I brought it up, the waiter went to check and it was available. So even if you dont see on the menu, make sure to ask. This was delicious too.  
- Grilled Asparagus: Decent
- For dessert, we ordered Churros - OMG, sooo good!!! Its served with hot chocolate syrup. I am craving he churros as I write this review.

Outdoor Seating: Excellent if you are NOT by the fireplace...

I made a reservation for Sunday brunch this past weekend for outdoor seating. It was a bit chilly, so I was happy to see that our table was by the fireplace...but only at first!

I highly recommend NOT sitting near the fireplace. You don't actually get any warmth from the fire, just ASH and SMOKE flying all over the place... in your hair, on your eyelashes, in your drinks and food...They don't really know how to manage the ash and smoke coming from it.  We asked several waitstaff over the course of the meal to make sure the netting was fully closed...And each of them would make it worse and kind of give up. Maybe they didn't want to get their hands dirty. Finally, my friend got up and completely closed the netting. My hair and clothes just absorbed the smoke, but I suppose that the way that the fireplace was designed and placed makes the smoke sort of circulate. Perhaps they will eventually put another screen in front to filter the ash...

Despite the ash in the outdoor seating, the service and food were excellent. We actually had 4 orders of the Crab Benedict, and it was pretty tasty. A nice change from the usual version. I liked the added spice in the sauce. 

Also loved the custom Bloody Mary bar. Though my buddy designed his own, I had the bartender help me with mine; and, it was delicious. Make sure to get a strip of bacon. Cocktail shrimp would have been a nice added touch to their bard, though.

The atmosphere is interesting. It's obviously very fancy, but the staff were all very casual in how they talked to customers, how they stood, how they interacted with each other. It was interesting to observe. There was some eye-grabbing art on the wall, including the word ""fuck"" in Spanish and a half naked woman, and I didn't understand why it was there. I was definitely missing something, but it was intriguing. It's also quite loud inside and the lighting is very dim. 

The food. First of all, the cocktails are delicious. Small, but beautifully blended flavors. I tried to beef empanadas and those were great. The small plates are small, but they are filling so don't let that deceive you. I tried the tortilla española, which was fine. Good, but not mind-blowing. The almond soup was perfect because I came in on a rainy day and was very cold, needing something to warm me up. As a plus, it was very tasty! Very small, like a tiny teacup size, but tasty. For desert we got the churros, which were filling and a pretty big portion and were amazing. I was very full and satisfied at the end of the meal.

907,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=SRjrCDKvwjWZ6lbrihu5Og,"Barcelona is back! 

I must say that after weeks of successive disappointments and sometimes anger, Barcelona is back to being what is was for me when I first moved to DC. One of the few places where you can find good food in this city. Last night (7/26/15) Barcelona was better than good, it was great. 

2 friends and I tried a plethora of dishes just to see if Barcelona had indeed made its way back to the ""one of DC's best "" status. 

We stayed away from the charcuterie because well, it is always amazing and we know that. 

The compte-rendu:
-The Gambas, they were smokey and done just right. The right amount of spiciness too.
- The scallops were amazing, tender and moist on the inside, crispy on the outside. The sauce it came in was just as great. I'll always get that dish again. I even dipped my bread in it after inhaling the scallops. Oh yea, the bread was great too.
- The short rib, was amazing! It was smokey, sweet, tasty. You ought to try it. (Side note, they should always be brought out with a proper knife, we tried we our regular know but had to ask for a steak knife)
- The watermelon salad although a great idea, being summer and all, I thought could be improved. It was good but maybe some more mint, to bring out the freshness and make sure the watermelon chunks aren't too warm from sitting in the kitchen would be a nice touch.
-The seafood Paella was one of my friend's favorite dishes of the night. I thought it was too tomato-y but don't take my word for it, I generally am not a seafood paella fan so in the words of my friend. It was the right amount of tangy,spicy,tomato-y, seafood/rice ratio and cooked perfectly.
-The paella salvaje was great! It was right back to what Barcelona used to dish out. The right amount of saffron, garlic, sausage and the right amount of doneness too. The only issue I have is that it was a bit too wet but I understand that maybe in wanting to bring two dishes out at the same time it might have been pulled a bit too early. That being said, it was still amazing and we all got excited about having amazing paella back on the menu!
- I've never had crepes for desert before but, it would be a mistake not to try those.
-The Churros, I usually hate Churros, they are never that soft, never that warm, never that sweet, never that light and fluffy. These were the best Churros I've ever had in my life.Period.

Disclaimer: since I believe in being completely honest and forthcoming, I must say that at the behest of Barcelona's prodigal son (Chef Adam is back and he brought great food with him) I went back to try the food there after having written it off. He promised good quality, new menu items and great taste. Delivered he did!

Besides the staff overlooking just minor details (the steak knife, having to ask different people people for an empty glass to mix some meds) I think they did a great job. Our waiter was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. The one who brought the desserts and suggested the Churros, I love her! 


We had a great time and will start going back to Barcelona a whole lot again! Thanks again Chef Adam!

With that being said, even during the insanity of a Friday night, the service is still pretty good. 

The food is satisfying but not mind blowing.  I'm not the  biggest fan of Tapas style food (especially when the meal is  so delicious - sharing?!) but it works for Barcelona.  I'm not completely wowed by the food but there are a few dishes that definitely had me wanting more.  Their meats are delicious.  This past Friday I tried the Chorizo and it was perfect.  I feel like the calamari has changed in recent months.  It's not as crispy as I remember it being.  The meatballs are ok.

After not being able to get a table on a Thursday night, we decided to come back the next Sunday.

If you are trying to get in for Happy Hour or during rush hour weekends  you might end it up waiting, waiting, and waiting some more, so try to book your reservations in reasonable foodie hours.

Wine menu is extensive so you should not have a problem pairing your food with a nice bottle of wine, and if you need any assistance servers (most of them) know what to suggest without trying to bleed you to death with the expensive stuff. At least that's how we felt with this particular individual who took care of us.

We came back here recently and things didn't go as well as the first time, but I'm gonna let that one pass, so let's continue with our first and more memorable experience at Barcelona.

Tapas were flying and landing on our table in a good pace. Our eyes were moving faster than usual trying to decide what to eat first. We were having a good time so we kept chatting sipping our Uruguayan wine (yes, from Uruguay, and it was good) letting the tapas accumulate on the table before going down to business with all force. 

Here's the list of the most succulent tapas we had that night and that I personally recommend to you fellow yelper: Ribeye, scallops, grilled lamb, papas bravas, hanger steak, and squid ink fideos.

I forgot to mention that their cheese selection is quite good, so if you know your cheeses that's great, but if not, let them suggest a few for you. 

The jamon serrano is a must along with the jamon iberico let that bad boy come to you, literally, rolling to your table. It could be a little salty for some, so be mindful with the wine you are planning on paring your cheese and the ham. 

Definitely, one of our favorite spots on 14th St. Well recommended for those out of town friends, or family. Not as expensive as Estadio but it could be if you over do it, so go nice and slow with the tapas, and don't order a lot at first, there's no reason why you should rush on this just sit down enjoy your wine and be happy.

We had made a reservation for 1 pm on a Saturday. We ended up getting there at 1:15 since none of the buses we needed to take came on time, but the hostess very graciously sat us within 5 minutes. 

Food: the bread starter was amazing. We asked for a second serving of the bread cause it was so good. Among 3 girls, we split the Patatas Bravas, the grilled hanger steak and the spiced beef empanadas.

We enjoyed all of our food. In order of my preference:

- the SPICED BEEF EMPANADAS were my favorite. the crust was light and flaky, the stuffing generously flavored. it wasn't spicy, but it had a nice kick. The plate comes with two small empanadas. 

- THE PATATAS BRAVAS were delicious. I don't like it when patatas bravas comes with too much sauce, cause sometimes it can be overwhelming. However, the patatas bravas at Barcelona came with a good amount of sauce and the potatoes were perfectly cooked!

- THE GRILLED HANGER STEAK comes with around 7 thin slices of meat cooked medium rare with the truffle vinaigrette drizzled lightly on top. it was good, but not mind-blowing. a solid choice nonetheless.

We made reservations (which I would say is a must) for 9:00pm this past Saturday. We had first tried for 8 or 8:30 but were told 9:00pm was the earliest we could be squeezed in. We were sat quickly, however, service was extremely slow the entire night, particularly before our order was taken and we were STARVING after the busy day my bf and I had earlier. That was really the only negative thing about our experience. Once we were finally able to order, service was still slow but we were not in a hurry so we did not mind at all. The wine list is incredible! I typically stick to the same varietal, but decided to branch out when I saw a pinot blanc, which I have never heard of before. I started with the Pinot Blanc blend, which was priced at $11/glass. IMO, that is on par with many of the wine bars I visit on a regular basis. It was light and refreshing, sweet but not overly so, with (I think) hints of peach and pear.  My bf started with a glass of Malbec, which to the surprise of us both, was priced at a mere $7/glass! I tried his, and while I am typically not a fan of Malbec, ordered a glass once our food arrived because it was so tasty! It had a hint of sweet coupled with tartness and, dare I say, even tasted a bit smokey. It was a unique taste that I highly enjoyed, as did he. 

Onto the food......bread was brought out first, which was nice because, as I said previously, we were famished! While the bread was quite tasty, hot, and fresh, the olive oil for dipping was not spiced or herbed and was just, well, bland. Another tip, which we learned after my bf had devoured the loaf of bread almost singlehandedly by himself, save the bread if you order any of the meat or cheese options since they are not paired with any bread. We asked our server how much food typically two people order and, since we were planning on ordering a board of meat and cheese, he suggested 3 tapas dishes. We ordered only 2 (they were out of the soft shell crab or it would have been three) and were plenty full upon completion. The meat and cheese for both of us was the standout of the night! We ordered the jamon serrano (dry curred Spanish ham), chorizo (pork sausage), a rosemary infused goat cheese (which was my absolute favorite), and a smoked sheep's milk cheese. There was a small portion of fig spread on the board which was perfect with the rosemary cheese! As I told my bf, next visit, we should just do meat and cheeses, particularly since I was less impressed with the tapas we ordered. I am not saying they were not tasty, however, they just did not compare to our appetizer. The two tapas we chose were the spiced beef empanadas, which were served with a spicy red pepper sauce, and hangar steak, topped with a truffled vinegrette. I preferred the empanadas over the steak, which surprised me because usually my tastes go in the opposite of that. I thought the spicy red pepper sauce nicely complimented the spice in the empanadas. I can't say I was a fan of the truffled vinegrette, and, although the steak appeared to be cooked medium rare, it was quite tough and chewy. Overall, I highly enjoyed our dining experience here and I thought the total of our bill, which was $70, was reasonable for 3 glasses of wine, 2 tapas, and 4 selections from the meat and cheese section of the menu. By the time we left, the patio area was full since the rain had cleared, and both the dining and the outside areas were hopping even though it was 10:30. If you're in the U street area, I'd recommend giving Barcelona a try-particularly the wine and the meats and cheeses. We will mkae a return trip for sure, possibly getting the paella, which I saw at the table next to us and it looked fabulous!

I lucked out though, as I spotted a nice couple in the bar area finishing their drinks and packing up.

989,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=mPziZxK8ilzav3oQKfC9Xg,"Review of the Bar only... I can sum it up in one word:

Go. 

I arrived a little bit earlier than my drinking partner for the evening and was able to snag the last table in the bar area. It was the last table because it was closest to the entrance and there was a cold breeze every time someone came in. But, if you're doing it right (aka drinking a lot of wine), then you will warm up pretty quickly and soon barely notice the cold.

From the host to the servers and runners, the service was just spectacular. Since my friend was leaving for dinner after happy hour, we didn't order any food. If our server was disappointed that that was the case, he never showed it because he was very nice and attentive. He helped guide us through the wines and even when we settled on one, just to be sure, he brought us tastings before committing to it. In retrospect, we are glad he did because some of the ones we picked we didn't end up liking. 

Oh and when I knocked my glass over (and caught it) but consequently splashed wine on the table next to us, there was a plethora of servers to help clean up and make sure everyone was ok. The glass didn't break, thankfully so the most painful part of it was being horribly embarrassed. 

I do plan on returning (hopefully many times!) to try out more wines and actually try some of the dishes. You'll need to go early (we got there at 5:30) because it fills quickly. And really, it's easy to see why.

We ended up ordering 6 different tapas to start: ham & chicken croquettes, patatas bravas, chorizo, asparagus, hangar steak, and the whipped sheep's cheese. They were all very tasty and we got super full off of all of that. They accidentally brought us some sort of mushrooms (we mistook it for the chorizo or steak), which we didn't like, but they quickly took that away after they realized the mistake.

The biggest disappointment was the seafood paella. It looked beautiful though - tons of clams, mussels, squid, and 2 big prawns! My friend immediately did not like it - she said it tasted like the ocean and she swore she was chewing sand. I also noticed it was rather sandy - I'm guessing the clams weren't cleaned properly, so the sand spread into the rice. The strong ""ocean"" taste my friend described was the squid, I think. Squeezing lemon juice onto it did not help lessen that strong taste.

I ended up getting it boxed up to go, since I was too full from the tapas and my friend had only taken about 3 bites. I gave the leftovers a try today and it didn't taste any better on an empty stomach and it was still really sandy, unfortunately. Perhaps we should have said something at the restaurant? My friend was really disappointed that it cost 24 dollars per person when she barely ate any of it. I am not a paella expert, but I was actually in Barcelona, Spain last month and had amazing seafood fideuà (similar to paella, but with little noodles) with garlic aioli sauce and it definitely did not taste like the ocean and did not contain sand.

Having read previous reviews about potentially long wait times for tables, we knew we wanted to get there before 7pm. We arrived around 6:30, and after about 5 minutes of standing behind a LARGE group of what appeared to be teenagers blocking the entrance to the hostess stand, we were invited by the hostess to snag the last full-service bar table rather than wait for a table in the back. We were thrilled, and also very impressed by the lady (manager?) who assisted in crowd control and passed around delicious snacks to us hangry diners. I managed to get my paws on a rissoto ball with ramp pesto and a mini truffle ham and cheese. The former was a winner, the later, well, let's just say it didn't spoil my appetite. 

The table we sat at was a mini 2-seater in the middle of 2 others. They were very close together, but not uncomfortably slow. After settling on the red sangria, we ordered the calamari, meatballs, some chickpea/spinach dish, and a potato souffle thing. The calamari was standard but delicious, the meatballs were great and I happily sopped up the sauce with my bread, the chickpea spinach dish was not even finished so you can tell our thoughts on that one, and the potato thing was weird. It was called a pancake on the menu, but it was not. For all you Jews out there, it basically reminded me of potato kugel, but even heavier on the eggs. Super weird, espeically when we were essentially expecting a latke. Never in my life have I wished I was eating potato kugel instead of a latke. 

The service was meh. Our intial server was pretty good, but then she disappeared for a while and a guy came around. But then he disappeared and she came back. All of our dishes were brought out at the exact same time which was a bit annoying since we were at a tiny table. And can I please talk about this one busser? who kept swooping in like a vulture and taking away plates the second we set them down. It was creepy and downright annoying. I finished my sangria, but before I had a chance to sample a piece of the fruit, he swooped in and the glass was gone. He even came in behind my roommate and grabbed something off the table like an octopus. All we saw were his arms before he disappeared again in a poof of ink. Disconcerting to say the least.

As we were about to ask for the check, we saw an amazing dessert pass by our table that we just HAD to have. The crepas, in a word, are amazing. 4 thin crepes rolled up with dulce de leche inside, with chocolate syrup and ice cream on top.

We were giving great advice on meals to order with a contagious level of enthusiasm from our server Kyle. I should note that to our pleasant surprise, Monday's are HALF-OFF WINE BOTTLES!  Overwhelmed with the variety of wine, our server sent over a wine expert who helped us select a nice Rosé. As one of our plates, we ordered a marinated cheese which apparently they had run out of. The manager came over and apologized and offered to select a cheese for us on the house to make up for it! Soo nice. At the end of the night, our server gave us to glasses of champagne on him to wrap up the night!

Food wise, the truffle bikini and the churros for dessert were my favorite. 

Overall, Barcelona nails the customer service experience which compliments it's gorgeous ambiance.

We got there around 9:30 and the place was packed. The patio is one of the nicest I've seen! They don't take reservations and we were ok with waiting a little to get a table at this place. The host was very friendly, took our name and a phone number. We were told that we can go walk around, as long as we didn't go too far, and when a table opens up we would be called. We got a call 10-15 after checking in, we were excited that a table opened up so fast and hurried back. When we got back to the host stand we were told that we need to wait another 20 min or so, I think there was a miscommunication between the two hosts on staff. The bar area was a zoo, there was no where to wait and no where to get a drink while we wait because people were eating meals at the bar and we didn't want to invad thier space.

All said and done the menu had many things that were appealing. We got 4 dishes to share and that was a good amount of food for us. Everything we ordered was very tasty, I recommend the bottom mushroom a la plancha.

1147,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=ZTGGQKoYglKrszhfKMBq8Q,"I was looking for a nice place to take my date for dinner; a place that had a classy bar, cool environment, great food; but something that was casual and not white table cloth fancy. After reading some of the reviews on here, and reaching out to a few fellow elite yelper friends, I decided on Barcelona. I was happy with my decision, and I think my date was too.

Smooth operator. I worked in restaurants for years and have had my share of dining experiences, and I have to say, this place runs pretty well for being so crowded. However, I felt like a waited a little too long for a drink at the bar upon me initial arrival. There were several bar tenders, but for some reason I was unable to catch their attention. Nevertheless, I was served and all was well.

The tapas at Barcelona are above average for DC style tapas. You know, like Jaleo and Cava, and all the other tapas style places in DC. It makes a lot of sense to serve tapas. It just works for this crowd. Anyways, the hangar steak, meatballs and mushrooms with goat cheese were really good, and I would get them again. The salad we had with cucumber was decent, but I might try something else next time. House bread is above average as well. We received a free flan for dessert from a table next to us (how nice of them!) so we got to try it. 

I really think flan will be the next big thing. Forget smoothies, and cupcakes, and dodgy food trucks. Think Georgetown Flan. Sweet Flan Frog. Tropical Flan. Flan is such a simple yet delicious dessert, but it can be royally screwed up if you don't know what you are getting into. Flan Shack. Just watch...

So here are some tips. Make a reservation a few days before your go. Show up early. Get a drink at the crowded bar and wait, or just go to another bar and get a drink while you wait (what we did). Then we went back like 20min before our actual reservation, and were seated promptly. If you are on a time crunch and need to be somewhere, I recommend not coming here really early or really late. We ate late, which was fine, because that's what the Spanish do over there, and they are cool.

Highly recommended.

I've been here a couple of times and gotten a few different tapas. 

Bunuelos de Bacalao--my question is--where is my bacalao?! Honestly, they're deliciously fluffy but you're lucky if your palate picks up on the slightest semblance of cod. 

Patatas Bravas--basically what you'd expect. 

Jamon and Chicken Croquetes--basically what you'd expect. Definitely not authentic, and not something that you'd get at Versailles in Miami. 

Calamari--meh.

Mushrooms and herbed goat cheese--DO NOT GET THIS. The two tastes simply don't go together, the cheese and canned mushrooms--yuck. 

Chorizo and sweet and sour figs--there's a story here that at the very least will leave you with the understanding that service at this place is superb. I ordered this and surprisingly, it was my favorite dish out of the many. I could do with a little more chorizo and a little less fig--but, I digress. Anyways I'm really putting my back into it, tryna cut that chorizo. I got a serious upper body work out. One of the floor managers passes by and sees me at it, apologizes, and sends a brand new, not overcooked, order of the chorizo. I thought it was a nice gesture and also just tasted much better. 

Suckling Pig--just really sounds totally unappetizing. The word ""suckling"" just makes me think of a little baby pig feeding at the teeth of the mama big before being sent off to the slaughter. Regardless, surprisingly delicious and flavorful. 

I had a few more plates, but you get the idea. It's pretty hit or miss; most things are standard tapa recipes; some things border on delicious. It's a GREAT addition to the 14th St. area and not a bad place to sip on some wine. Also, the olive oil they serve is AMAZING. I got the name from our server but I lost the piece of paper. I try not to eat too much bread but I made an exception and just pigged out on bread and olive oil before dinner.

I wanted them to be like Argentinian dulce de leche crepes, but instead they were cold to accommodate the whipped cream filling.  My bad for not knowing that instead of mouthfuls of rich sweet dulce de leche, crepas salgueros have a little bit of oddly tangy dulce de leche + some unsweet whipped cream and crepes that are kinda soggy/spongy.  Overall - bland.

The chocolate hazelnut indulgence was quite good but no better than the tiny chocolate cakes I've had elsewhere.  It comes out very hot and with a drizzle of decorative raspberry sauce which struck me as weird with the mild hazelnut notes, but otherwise quite good.

Basically, I wouldn't go back for the desserts.  Service was good, though.  They kept my tiny water glass full most of the time, which is tough given how much I drink.   The waiter was patient with my questions and the cold food came out immediately, which was nice.

The tapas were a mixed bag too, with the smoked trout pate having a nice texture and a very very subtle smokey flavor.  Mostly it tasted like milder tuna salad.  The single piece of bread that came out with it was burned, but I probably could have gotten more/non-burned bread if I'd asked.  The whipped goat cheese with pimenton was quite tasty, great texture - again, single piece of burned bread.  Not badly burned, but who wants to pay $7 for cheese and have the flavor overwhelmed by burnt toast?

The thing we loved was the squid ink fideos w/calamari - rich, warm flavors, striking presentation, nice sized portion.  Took quite a while to come out, as did our desserts, but we already had the cold tapas, so that worked out fine.  

The spiced cocktails we had were interesting, strong and flavorful.

Atmosphere was warm and sunny with the big window, comfortable seating, and the dining room felt spacious despite the crowds piled at the entrance, the bar and outside.  Since the fideos was so good, now that I know what to ask for (no burnt bread please) and what to avoid (no crepas salgueros), I think I'd give them another try.

On the positive side, Barcelona has a stellar wine list that's heavy on Spanish wines and styles you don't see every day. It's unique and everything I tried was great (2 glasses of my own, plus sips of my fiancee's 2 wines). The service is also wonderful--our waiter was extremely attentive, the food came quickly, and a manager stopped in to check on how everything was going.

On the negative side, I just didn't think the food was all that outstanding, particularly for the price and for the hype this place has. We ordered a cheese plate and 5 small plates (3 of which were vegetarian) and it came out to a combined $70 (not including wine). For that kind of money, I want outstanding food, and this was merely good. With all of the other tapas places in this city competing for my dollar, I just can't see myself coming back here.

Yes, it's a chain, but it doesn't feel like one.  How many chains (or just restaurants in general) have a huge fireplace outside with heat lamps and blankets all around no matter what the weather?  Most likely none, or if so, it might be your backyard.

Drinks are good, but expensive, however, it's par for the course for Logan Circle/DC and the cheese/charcuterie plate that we had was fairly standard, but well priced.

First is with the special Jamon Serrano presentation.  When you order it, the chef comes out with the leg and carves at the side of your table.  It's a very enjoyable experience.  My only issue is I wish he'd wear a glove while carving and placing the jamon on plate.  I'm not naive enough to imagine the chef team wears gloves while cooking, but if you're carving at my table, a bit of cleanliness goes a long way.  

Second is with the sommelier.  We asked three different people if he could offer advice on wine choices, and each person said they would bring him over.  He never came.  Later in the meal, we found out he wasn't even in house.  That's all we needed to know, but no one told us until it came out casually.  Not a big deal, but frustrating.

Happy hour runs from 4-6 and they offer $5 select wines and $3 and $4 select small plates.  I got to try the whipped cheese with pistachio topping.  It was quite delectable but could have used one or two more pieces of bread with it.

For food, I got to try the albondigas (meatballs), grilled hangar steak, calamari, and the sardines.  The stand out plate was the grilled hangar steak.  It was freakkin delicious.  The meatballs were also really good although fairly safe/standard.  I thought the calamari was a little tough and the sardines were, well, sardines.  I don't really like them but gave them another try.  I still don't like them.  Shrug... either you do or you dont.

There were lots of wines to choose from and I tried several but was not blown away by any.  I thought they were all pretty mediocre.  As I'm writing this now, I'm sad I forgot to try the sangria since I heard its quite tasty too.

Our waiter was super friendly and did a great job with our group and the host was also accommodating when I arrived as well.

I definitely look forward to coming back to try a few more food items!

First time I went I hated it. Seemed pretentious and douchy and overrated. We asked the sommolier to give us a glass of what he would consider his best wine, most representative of what they were trying to accomplish, etc. I returned it. It was blah and, almost not good. Um...unless it's corked, over-oxygenated, etc. how can wine be not good??? Was bored and annoyed with the people and the place, so I left.

Said I didn't wanna go back. Made friends change locations I didn't wanna go back.

Somehow ended up goin back. 

Um. Wow. I begrudgingly had to admit the snacks we ordered were good. All of them. The wine I had was on point too; had a great malbec and I think I moved to a tempranillo. They have cava (natch), so I ordered a bottle for our toast to my friends who were just engaged. The mixed drinks were fun and yum.

Our large party of about 11 people moved to the outside dining area to sit amongst the heat lamps and, wait, what's this? Clean super soft blankets to keep us warm against the relentless winter that never ends? Wait, and did i mention...CLEAN??

Ooooh, and then you have the blistered shishito peppers just like I remember eating in Madrid all the time and can never find here?? Oh, and the other food actually does remind me of time spent in Spain? The rest of the food actually was good quality and not just a bunch of gimmicky sauces hiding fundamentally flawed culinary techniques? Ooooh....I guess I do like you... (we tried almost every dish. I was consistently surprised by how authentic and good the food was.)

Went back again last night for my birthday. Apparently I traded in cake for humble pie. We wanted to do a hh there and then move on. The space is large so it's a bit ideal when you aren't sure who's comin when. The only thing that's bad is the service continues to be really really really slow.

This place is fabulous, especially for being open for only 2 weeks. Let's start off with drinks -- happy hour ends at 6 p.m.: that sucks. However, Sangria pitchers made by your bartender = awesome. So delicious. We had 5 (pitchers). $23 each.

Service - spectacular. Shout out to Cory and Dominic. Extra shout out to the amazing manager Kyle who brought us desserts on the house when one of our orders got sent to the wrong table and sat and chatted with us for awhile. Love you Kyle. Plus he makes a mean sangria.

Food - good. It wasn't mind blowing, but it was good. Super fast to come out, always refilling our bread. Highlights: Hanger Steak, Cheese Jamon Croquettes, Spinach-Chickpea dip. Migas del Momento - the sauce was pretty amazing. Delicious, delicious FLAN! 

Ambiance - spectacular. This place is just awesome. They have the heaters on in the patio and fleece blankets. There is plenty of standing room at the bar. Bathroom had great decor and style. Open kitchen.

Everything from the food, service, music, decor and atmosphere. We started with the jamon mangalica, which was incredible, and i strongly recommend it. We also had the brussel sprouts, patatas bravas, chorizo with tripe, gambas al ajillo, albondigas, and churros y chocolate and warm chocolate hazelnut indulgence. We enjoyed them all. The portion size for the churros was surprisingly large. With everything we had ordered, we were already very full, but we still decided on desserts anyway. The waiter actually messed up on our order and brought us another chorizo tapa instead of the one we ordered. Upon telling him of the error, he informed us the dish would be on the house and he would remove it from our bill, which I thought was a nice gesture, even though we had already ordered enough food to keep us plenty full. All in all, it was a lovely meal, for $74 for 5 plates of food (not including the dish brought to us in error), 2 desserts, and 1 glass of wine, I thought this was a really really good value and dinner experience.

Sitting outside when it was 30 degrees out at a table built for munchkins: 3 stars

I've been wanting to go to Barcelona for months so when the time came for a New Years Eve plan, I told Boyfriend that I had it covered. 

Our reservation was for 8, and we were seated around 8:10; no biggie. New Years Eve is a crazy night at best. The host lead us outside to the patio area, and up into the front section with the fireplace. Normally, this would've been fine, and I understand that they want to fill every possible seat on a lucrative evening like NYE. But the three tables up in the front part of the patio are about 2 feet off the ground with stools that stand about a foot. My 6' tall Boyfriend had a heckuva time folding himself in to fit. Even little old 5'5"" me with heels on was uncomfortable. And granted, if you're only there for one round of tapas and a glass of wine, you could probably deal. But this was our plan to ring in the new year: dinner and lots of wine at Barcelona. I wish I was kidding when I say that 3 days later, my butt still feels bruised from the stools. I wish that they had maybe asked people before sitting them up front. The rest of the seats, further back on the patio and inside, were designed for normal sized humans, from what I could tell.

Aside from the physical seating arrangements, as I mentioned earlier, it was 30 degrees out. I had purchased an adorable new dress for the occasion, but had to keep my jacket on all night because I was so cold. Yes, they had heat lamps and a fireplace...but it was 30 degrees. A ploy to get us to drink more wine? Maybe. And one last detail...the fireplace didn't seem to be drawing properly, and the front of the patio was filled with smoke for most of the night. Our closet still smells like a campfire. Just not ideal.

But now...the food.

The bar manager Chelsey came by and made sure we found a bottle of wine that worked for us. I really appreciated that when I said we didn't want to go over $40, she was totally understanding and even suggested one of the cheapest $28 bottles. And it was great wine. Ten points to Chelsey.

We started with a meat a cheese platter: jamon serrano, chorizo picante and the cana de cabra. All excellent. The cana de cabra in particular; reminded me of the incredible goat cheeses I fattened myself up on when I lived in France.

Next round, tapas:
Crispy Sunchokes - Delicious, but probably not worth the money. Super cute little potato chips, basically.
Brussels Sprouts - Oh man. I mean, I love these little cabbages when they're just roasted with sea salt. But the chorizo vinaigrette brings a really amazing salty and acidic quality that I'm still dreaming about.
Oyster en Escabeche - I'm not an oyster fan, so these were lost on me. Boyfriend seemed to really enjoy them, though.
Foie Gras and Sherry - Sweet Jesus this was rich. The foie was like butter, and the fig/ginger compote was spot on. If you take a sip of sherry right after you swallow the foie...perfection.
Patatas Bravas - Because so many other people on here have raved about these things, I had to try them. The potatoes are basically homefries. The real winners here are the sauces. I'm determined to figure out how they made that garlic aioli. I would eat it on my cereal.
Spiced beef empanadas - Perfectly acceptable, but not the stars of the show. I was a little disappointed that they used ground beef...I was expecting shredded.
Grilled Hanger Steak - Another knockout. The steak melted in my mouth and the vinaigrette kicked it to a whole different dimension of lightness and earthiness all at once.

However...the real star...was the Peking Duck. It's not on their menu on the website right now, but you might want to call ahead and make sure it is before you eat there. It was mindblowing. The duck was so moist and tender that it was falling off the bones on the plate. The glaze was sweet but not overpowering. One question mark I had was the huge truffle shavings on top of it. I had honestly never had truffle before, and now that I have...I don't get it. I don't think the earthiness really added anything to the flavor of the duck, and it is a crazy expensive garnish to just throw on top. Who knows.

We ended with the warm chocolate hazlenut indulgence...I think. At this point, we had each had a cocktail, a bottle of wine, and were halfway through a bottle of champagne. Dessert is a little fuzzy. I'm sure it was excellent.

The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because, while I understand its a hot new restaurant and we expected to wait well over 2 hours to be seated, we also did expect for the service to be on point when we finally did sit. Maybe someone didn't show up for their shift but overall the feel was that the entire wait staff was stressed out and too busy. Which was unexpected because there seemed to be at least 5 host.
Our server forgot our sangria that we ordered and kept forgetting if he had taken our order, and even offered us dessert after we already ate 3 desserts and asked for the check. Poor guy.

Most importantly though the food- non less that 5 stars there! We had a table of 5 and each ordered 2 tapas to split a total of 10 and it was the perfect amount of food. The calamari, cauliflower, meatballs and mushrooms were my favorite!
Next time I'd love to try out their meat and cheese platters- they look awesome!

My mom was visiting from out of town and we wanted some good wine and small bites. It was Saturday night at 720 (poor planning on our part!) and we were originally quoted an hour, but the hostess noticed a first-come, first-serve table open up and sprung to get it for us. HUGE win!

We weren't looking to spend a ton of money, so I pointed out a few bottles of wine in the 20s to the waiter. He asked me what we liked and pointed to a few in my price range. I narrowed it down to two bottles and he brought over samples for me to try. I liked the slightly less expensive bottle better, and he didn't try to upsell me. We ordered the patatas braves (try these!) and the calamari (leave them). We were torn between the mushrooms with salsa verde and the eggplant mole for a final dish, and he recommended the mushrooms. We trusted his recommendation, but when he delivered them he said he was sending eggplant on the house for us to try. The mushrooms were phenomenal, and true to his word, better than the eggplant. It was great, personal service on a night when every single table (and bar stool ... and available space!) was taken -- the mark of a place that knows what it's doing!

It was the most unpleasant dining ambience I've ever been in. 

So When Patrick, the manager, stopped by and asked how everything was, (no idea how he navigated his way to our table through the crowd) I told him it was a very unpleasant situation.

The hubs and I got there at 6:30 and waited in a very long line at the host stand.  Before we got to the front I asked him what our threshold was, were we willing to wait two plus hours?  The hoards of people around the bar and in the outside standing area was overwhelming as was the line at the host stand, so I just assumed it would be a long wait.  But, to my surprise the host was very nice and said he'd have us seated in 30-45 minutes. Perfect! 

We left and went to a less crazy establishment to get a happy hour drink while we waited.  We returned about 40 minutes later, just in case they called us.  My husband walked to the host stand and asked where we were on the list, our service was bad at the previous bar and he was worried he had missed the text.  The hostess told him to just hang tight, she'd go ahead and take care of us right there.  He grabbed me and we were seated, again perfect!

Our server was attentive and immediately greeted us.  Our drinks took a little while and they only brought me a half a glass of wine, but fixed it quickly.  My husband was able to order a rare Spanish porter which made him super happy, he was the first to enter it into Untapped.  

We ordered the blue cheese which was giant and came with four different jams and spreads (fig, date, guava paste, and apricot) all of which were delicious.  It did not come with any kind of cracker or baguette for spreading though which would have been nice.

We then ordered our first rounds of tapas, the meatballs and empanadas.  Both were delicious.  The empanadas were spicy and well flavored and the meatballs had a great tomato sauce.  Our second and final round was hangar steak with black truffle vinaigrette.  This was to die for, sometimes hangar steak can be chewy and tough, but they sliced it very thin and cooked it medium rare so it just melted in your mouth.  We also ordered the Chorizo with a poached egg on top, very good.  The chorizo pieces were mini-bite size and pieces of panzanella accompanied it.     Finally, we had the chickpea spread (read, hummus) that was incredible.  

We left very satisfied and with a bill lower than I had expected (80 bucks).  Once we stepped out, the host called to let us know that our table was available.  Hmmm, well that's about an hour over what our quoted time was, good thing my husband worked his magic.  

I do have to knock off a star, because I was hoping it would be a little cozier.  It's so large and it's apparent the servers are trying to get you in and out as short a time as possible (I mean I get it, the place is in high demand).

Understandable being a Thursday night.  We had a big party and were standing by the door unfortunately blocking traffic.  Out of nowhere one of the cooks approached us and offered a couple of complimentary jamon & chicken croquettes (absolutely perfect!, must order).  Later, as the wait increased, they offered us to stand by the kitchen where they served us a few complimentary tapas (served by the head chef no less) and a round of drinks, apologizing for the wait.  Was very impressed by this and the friendly service (from host staff and waiters).

Go for the white sangria, avoid the red.  Kale salad was excellent.  Pickled beet, toasted walnut and valdeon cheese (think blue & goats) was surprisingly well done.  Whipped sheep's cheese with paprika and pistachio was served with two pieces of fresh bread poking outwards. More delicious excellence here.  they also served fresh rockfish with lemon but I'm allergic to fish so I avoided it.

Once we were seated we ordered the jamon serrano (think Italian prosciutto), chorizo picante & more valdeon cheese among the meats and cheeses section of the menu.  The warm, fresh bread brought to the table almost melted in the mouth.

Among the tapas we had a spinach and chickpea cazuela tapa (excellent), the mushroom dish was heavy with what tasted like balsamic vinegar and rosemary.  Good but too rich for me.  We also ordered the potato tortilla (which was good, but didn't blow me away.

Great wine selection, (had the Chilean pinot noir), the bramble snap cocktail was expertly prepared.  If you still have room for dessert, the ""crepas salguero"" are a must (crepes with dulce de leche and chocolate sauce, with vanilla ice cream) and perfect to share.  I also recommend the Catalan flan as well.

The only slight drawback was the table sizes are small so it was a bit tight passing tapas around the table and making space but it wasn't a terrible inconvenience.

I always want to order pancakes but feel overwhelmed eating it all myself, so this is a great dish to share; the pancakes are fluffy and moist and the lavender honey is a fun contrast to maple syrup.  Also yummy: pork belly paella dish (I don't remember the exact name of this, and it's a new dish); this isn't exactly paella but instead of rice it's a noodle form. Really liked the pork belly, vegetables, and seasoning. OK: Chorizo de Soria and Patatas Bravas (I thought the sauce was too mayo-ey). We somehow managed to squeeze in some dessert too! The warm chocolate indulgence was divine! Churros with chocolate sauce (with a little kick!) was also a nice treat!

That being said, this is where anything even remotely resembling a negative experience ended. After a glass of wine and the first round of tapas, we forgot all about being cramped and enjoyed every minute of our experience. One of the managers was walking around the busy dining room acting as a sommelier of sorts. He was very friendly and helpful and assisted us in choosing a very good (and inexpensive I might add) bottle of wine to go with the delicious small plates. The grilled chorizo was my personal favorite. We also had the Patatas Bavas, Jamon and Chicken Croquettas, and Hanger Steak. All great!

The waitresses are quite nice and knowledgeable. The only reason that they don't have a 5 star here is because it seems like our meal was rushed by the waitress that was helping us. We were still working on the food but she just was so eager to take a plate away so she asked us a few times. Even though it was Saturday lunch, it was already passed the rush hour, so I don't understand why she did that. 
Anyways, the food was quite authentic. For two people, we ordered churros, confit duck salad, mushroom and herbed goat cheese, as well as spicy eggplant caponata. I would highly recommend the churros - very different from the churros sold on the street, and quite similar to the churros in Spain. I like the confit duck salad but nothing too spectacular. The mushroom and herbed goat cheese was a good combination if you like goat cheese.

In fact, it was so good my friend and I thought maybe the restaurant thought we were food critics -- but the reviews below suggest that the customer service is just operating at a different level.

My friend got there before me, around 7 pm.  There was a crazy line, and he told the host that we might leave to go elsewhere.  The host said he thought he could seat us sooner and I think basically helped us cut the line.  I noticed a comment below that someone thought they were not seated due to their race.  My friend is African-American, and the host and other staff were super-accomodating and really went out of their way for us.  So perhaps what happened to the person who commented below was just a mistake, and they are also trying to make up for it now.

My friend ordered this super-amazing-I-could-drink-it-all-the-time bourbon drink with cardamom and lavendar bitters.  I ordered something else.  Our waiter asked what we thought, and I said mine was good but his was amazing.  The waiter swapped my drink out, gratis.  So I also partook of awesomeness.  Then someone who I believe was the owner stopped by, plus some other wait staff, to see how our meal was.  In DC, that's just weird - in a nice way.

I thought the hanger steak was great, and the eggplant carbonata.  My friend loved the ceviche.  I was recently in Lima and perhaps as a result was less wowed.  The grilled mushrooms were nice but not amazing.  The beet salad was solid.  Then our waiter brought us a flourless chocolate cake with coconut ice cream.

My boyfriend ordered the scallops, and wholeheartedly said they were the best he's ever had.  I had the beet salad, which I found to be refreshing and delicious.  We splurged and finished with the chocolate and caramel crepes, which we highly recommend.  The cocktails were inventive, and they have an adequate (however overpriced) beer selection.

1520,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=U5KvcMDaru2nLv-EfFImgQ,"Went here on a Friday evening at about 7:30.  Like any new place on 14th St, I was prepared for a mob scene.  On that point, it delivered.  Host told us an hour wait, and since it was pouring outside, we decided to stick it out.    The restaurant itself is beautiful.  I wish it hadn't been raining, because their patio looks amazing.

Grabbed a drink at the bar to pass the time; drinks are DC average priced ($4.50 to $9 for a beer and $10-$12 for a specialty cocktail) bartender was super friendly.  Luckily the wait was less than expected, but we sat in the line of tables along the bar (which was packed).  So, got a table quickly, but it was in a difficult part of the restaurant.  The tables by the bar are not first come first served, but rather, you can be sat there (at least, this is how it was during this Friday visit).  This isn't necessarily a problem, but with a table of four, two people will be basically right in the middle of the ""aisle"" the waitstaff walks through to deliver food to the tables along the bar window.  One of the floor managers (I guess) joked that ""we probably know all of the names of the waiters by now"" given how up-on-our-grills they have to be when walking by.  Lucking, we were in a relaxed mood so no much of a problemo.  But I'd say they need to figure out what to do wit these bar tables; a crowd mean lots of opportunities for food and drinks to be knocked over out of waiters' hands.  Two full glasses of wine were bumped off a tray right next to us, forks and knives being knocked to the ground every where, and a few more close calls.  Added a bit of an edge to the evening.  But again, not very much anyone could do about it given how busy it was.

On to the meal!  Our waitstaff team was fantastic.  Cory and Stephanie are a dynamic duo.  Very attentive considering how busy it was, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  And despite a rude table next to us that waved a flashlight in Stephanie's eyes to get her attention WHILE SHE WAS TAKING OUR ORDER, she was polite to them and didn't skip a beat when she was ""allowed"" to come back over to us.  Cory was great as well; responsive to our needs and made things right when they thought there was a wrong.  For example, Cory replaced what was left with one glass of wine when he saw drips of another drink he was serving (passing over the table) fall into that glass.  That was a classy act, in my opinion.

Food was fantastic.  Really, really good.  Though I've never been to Barcelona the city and can't gauge its authenticity, the food presented to us was delicious.  Had a bit of the Crispy Calamari, Potato Tortilla, Mushrooms and Herbed Goat Cheese, Spiced Beef Empanadas, Grilled Lamb Chops, Croquettes, and this delicious goat cheese and honey thing that I could have taken a bath in it was so good.  Even the bread they dish out was yummy.

For comparison's sake, Barcelona blows Georgetown's Bodega out of the water.  I've kind of always thought Bodega was overrated, but Barcelona totally proves that there's something better out there.  Jaleo (Chinatown location) is delicious as well; and I'd say the quality and attention to detail of Barcelona and Jaleo are on an equal plane, but I'd go back to Barcelona first because the flavors to me were richer, and dare I say the portions made me feel fuller.

The four of us got out of there spending about $30 each, and I felt satisfied (always a danger with small plates).

This visit earned four stars.  Had we been sitting in the main part of the dining room, I probably would have given it five.  While we were prepared for the ""Friday night new restaurant"" atmosphere, it was pretty intense.  However, the staff was super nice and knowledgeable and the food was delicious.  Music was great and on a normal night, I the atmosphere would be great as well.  Of course, if mob scene is a ""normal night,"" I'd wait to be seated in/request the main dining room.  Overall, great place for Spanish-style tapas, and the preferred place among the ones I've been to in the city.

The weather was beautiful and the patio doors were opened and we managed to get a great seat right inside but felt like it was outside. The food was delicious starting with the warm bread that came out. We ordered a pitcher of traditional sangria as it was worth the price. Absolutely delicious! The color was a deep but vibrant purple like I never had seen but the flavor was wonderful as the fruit had soaked for a while in it. My daughter got a grilled cheese and we started with the fried calamari and shrimp tapas (forgetting the name). The calamari was fresh and what I love most is that they served tentacles and did not slice the body of the calamari. The light fry along with the smoked aioli was fantastic! The shrimp were fire roasted whole and seasoned nicely. Texture was on point. A light tasty tapas but the calamari overwhelmed this dish by far. Next we ordered some entrees thinking they would be small too. I ordered the Barcelona Benedict. It was your play on the classic eggs Benedict but made with patas brava without the sauce and a really great house made sausage. The dish was served wrong as my poached eggs were over cooked. I believe this was not a cooks fault but the waiter was not attentive and probably let the dish under the warmer for a bit. The corrected the dish immediately but did not comp. My wife got the brioche French toast and loved it but was full. I tried it and really enjoyed the pairing with the apple butter. This a great place and would love to visit late in the evening to carat have the vibe. My 4 stars are for the service. The waiter broke a dish close to me, dropped silverware, and wasn't attentive.

The staff was absolutely amazing. Everyone was exceptionally nice and accommodating. Someone in our party wanted a booth, the hostess said it may not be possible without additional wait, but in the end she was able to accommodate.

The food menu isn't extensive but their wine list most certainly is! Pages upon pages. There is very little selection in the $150 and under range. We asked our waiter what would be good in the $150 range and he immediately called their sommelier. Our friend had a bottle in mind, but we asked anyway. He concurred with us and said the bottle we chose would complement our meal. 
We also had a selection of cheese and meats. It was divine with the wine.
I chose the fish as my entree. I found it a little flavorless, it was flawlessly presented of course, but it lacked flavor in my opinion.  As a matter of course there was no salt or pepper on the table. This is usually the case at restaurants with a Chef rather than a cook. I didn't bother asking since the portion wasn't big. This would be my only complaint. Although my food wasn't as good as it looked, the whole experience more than made up for it. It is by no means cheap eating here, but once in a while is good to indulge.

We discovered Proof on our own last year before we were about to head back home, so we really did not have enough time to relax and see what this was all about, but we did have a couple appetizers and come good wine by the glass, promising we would be back this year to enjoy the WHOLE experience.  This year we were lucky to be able to share it with our new friends from Yelp Broward-Palm Beach, Tairyn and Alex, who came up here to see the Cherry Blossoms.  

Why did we stop here in the first place and want to come back?  The atmosphere. Anytime I can see from the outside, nicely displayed wines in an open wine cellar and a cozy entrance, it definitely brings me in.  Proof is just like that.  The very first impression really got me so excited and to see it again and get greeted by two friendly hostesses as we arrived first was a pleasure. We had time to kill, so we sat on their comfortable soft, cozy couches next to their elegant and vibrant bar area to order some wine while we waited for our friends.  The hostess was so attentive to our reservations because she always came over to update us on our table and how soon it would be ready. When our friends arrived, we told her not to worry, we were all going to enjoy a glass of wine where we were sitting.  We joked around with her a little and she was really playful with us.  We had asked her for a booth, not knowing that there were few left, she made it happen and got us a great comfortable booth.

Immediately our server came over who thought he knew us from another restaurant he worked at last year that we did go to, and it was probably him that waited on us. He was so friendly, as he dropped off the wine list and menus.  We were in a happy place, with really great, attentive servers.  

THE WINE LIST:  Wow!!!  I was overwhelmed by what they offered, from so many countries, and regions from all over the world and a vast variety of varietals and blends.  If I had to guess, the list was about 50 pages long.  Best of the Best from California and other regions, but because of that, most of the wines were  VERY pricey, which is ok, but...... there were very few wines less than $150.00 and a few under $100.00.  This was the ONLY negative about Proof.  They must get some more reasonable priced wines on their list, and there  are plenty to choose from that they can stock. We ended up ordering a Nebbiolo from California from one of the two Sommelier's.  Ben was great and really helped us with this choice and the fruitiness of this wine was exactly how he described it.  We all loved it.  Thank you Ben.  You know your wines.  It was so nice how Ben laid out our 4 glasses (and I love their wine glasses) on a tray in front of us, opened the wine to taste and get served. Very Classy service.

I love the menu and one of the other reasons we wanted to come back was to try their Charcuterie cheeses and meats with the wines. We made it simple and ordered the Chef's Charcuterie with two great choices of cheeses and two meat selections, including a real nice Soppressata.  Along with this, they served it with fantastic crunchy baked bread and a Fig Jam and Dijon Mustard.  Great choices and went great with the Nebbiolo.  If you walk towards the back of the restaurant, they have a separate area just for prepping the cheeses and meats.  Grabbed a shot of that.  My wife ordered the Beet Salad, with Arugula and Goat Cheese and she raved about it!!!

Their Entrée menu is FANTASTIC and it was very hard to make choices, but our server was helpful.  My wife had the Salmon served with pickled mustard greens and shitake mushrooms. Alex and I ordered the Roasted Lamb Loin with dill potatoes, recommended Medium Rare.  It was sliced and tender as butter.  The sauce it was served with, and Meyer Lemon gave this a tremendous flavor with such tenderness.  Melted in my mouth. Tairyn had the Banana Leaf Halibut with Coconut Green Curry.  She really enjoyed it.  The presentations of all our dishes were beautiful and the flavors were perfect and not too overbearing. The wine went nice with everything we ordered throughout the night.

All the staff at Proof really make the experience.  From the hostess to the server to the Sommelier, they interacted with us so naturally and made the evening so pleasant. 

The big highlight besides the food and the service is what I started out with.  The atmosphere. The brick walls, wood floors and comfortable seating, surrounded by wine displays is my thing and we could not help but to make that part of this experience.  

Washington D.C. has some fantastic places to eat, and I says a lot for us to remember to come back to this one place, Downtown, our first night here.  We never forgot.

Having heard great reviews of the restaurant for dinner, I figured they would do brunch right as well. I went with a group of my friends and we all opted to try different dishes to get a real feel for how great the brunch menu was. Overall we ordered the ""Angry Eggs"" (spicy lamb, tomato, eggplant, and crispy potatoes), ""Maple Sage Sausage and Smoked Bacon"", and the Smoke Trout Benedict (with potato lakes and tomato hollandaise). I was a bit nervous about trout benedict because I'm a huge eggs benedict fan and I didn't want this to taint my opinion - but I was pleasantly surprised!

Inside decor is modern and classy, but the bar area has some tight seating; people kept bumping into my seat with their seats.

Happy hour specials are $5 select wines and snacks. Had the tempranillo and the cheese & charcuterie for two. Happy with the quality and amount of food, but pretty disappointed in the lack of variety on the charcuterie tray - only two types of cheese and two types of meat. Also no choices with happy hour wines - only 1 red (tempranillo) and 1 white. 

Proof opens at 4PM for happy hour and if you arrive early, they make you stand outside with no apologies. I wish they offered more choices for the happy hour as well.

Why I haven't been here before, I don't know.  I like wine. It seems like a natural place for me to go especially in my stomping grounds of Penn Quarter/Chinatown.  I stopped by with a friend for happy hour. Great selection of wines, nice open area where we were able to snag a seat in the bar area.  The vibe was lively, but mellow.  A great place for girls to get together to gab with their big wine glasses.

Happy hour.  The menu was not enticing at all. About 5 signature cocktails at $8, a white wine and a red one for $5 and some beer.  The food was in the regular priced food menu.  No happy hour specials.  Service was cool; nothing to give me warm and fuzzies about, but the wine and food warmed me up.

We noshed on the cheese board and prosciutto.  Safe choices, but it was really good with my not so good house, white wine from the happy hour menu (a basic white wine with a hint of souse loaf taste?  I'm no sommelier, but that's what I got from it.)  The combination of my friend being on Cloud 9 from her love of wine and cheese, perhaps the alcohol content of my wine, and that I love meat and cheese with wine we had an all around good experience.  I look forward to returning for dinner, lunch or dessert! Or to try a better wine!

It's the perfect spot for a business-type lunch because it is decently fancy, but not quite DBGB or Rasika-level, which would be a bit extravagant for quick mentor-mentee chat. Indeed, when I arrived today at 1pm, it was booming with the voices of suited-up business people. Actually, it was hard not to stare at the very loud man behind me.

Lunch at Proof starts out the way all meals at a restaurant should: with a basket of free carbs. These long rectangular-shaped crackers are my everything. They are sprinkled prettily with coarse sea salt which adds that extra bit of umph. I could happily eat them plain, but obviously I slather them in the fresh tzatziki dip that comes on the side. Mmmm. I'd say this tops the free pita bread around the corner at Zaytinya, fo sho.

The lunch entrees range from pasta and fish stew to panini and salad -- fairly all over the place -- with prices tending to hover around $15, which was the price of my Grilled Shenandoah Lamb Burger. It came out that perfectly pink shade of medium rare, buried beneath a pile of fried onions that I delicately munched upon with my fingers. The burger wasn't groundbreakingly delicious, particularly given the sadly untoasted bun, but decent. The real star, however, were the impressively cubical chickpea fries, which were crisp on the outside but delightfully mushy on the inside. They almost seemed healthy -- I mean, they ARE made of legumes. The harissa aioli dip for the fries was a bit rich for something already so oily; I think I would've preferred ketchup to be honest. 

My favorite part about weekday lunches at Proof is that they offer a $14 wine-and-entree option. Last time, I had a crabcake sandwich with a glass of white wine, which made me feel like I was on vacation in Europe again, hunting down the best boozey prix-fixe lunch deals in Southern France. Sigh. Where was I? Ah yes, the grimey corner in Chinatown where Proof sits. While I haven't been to Proof for dinner, I do endorse its very good lunch specials.

It's located in a busy part at the end of Chinatown so I suggest grabbing an Uber or metro to avoid the headache of parking.  

The restaurant itself is dimly lit with a calm and classy atmosphere they have wine on display from top to bottom and an impressive collection of reserve jeroboams.

You can get a fairly pretentious or gauche vibe from the menus and staff at times, but the pricing is on point for the most part.  

The food was exceptional...I highly recommend trying their cheese plate (the Cashel Blue and Leonora Goat were unforgettable); the pickled plate was hit or miss with some items being much better than others.

I loved their take on foie gras with cherries short cake for an appetizer, and then the swordfish with little neck clams was in a perfect light/flavorful sauce...truly great meal.  I also got to sample the gnocchi    which was delicious and 'melt in your mouth' cooked to perfection, but it was a very rich plate that should be shared in place of an entree...also, the fried tofu entree was exceptional but also saltier and richer than I'd prefer for a huge piece of protein.

My fiancé and I went kind of late on a Saturday night. We made reservations via Open Table but that was probably not necessary. The place was surprisingly sparse. 

I was first impressed with the wine book they handed me but quickly noticed most bottles were well over $100. I settled on a Nebbiolo blend at the low price of $60. It ended up being a good choice but would likely have been $20 less at other wine places. Their specialty cocktail list was not impressive but my fiancé informed me they made an excellent Old Fashioned. 

When I got to the food menu I honestly wanted to order everything. The small plates and entrees were unique and they all sounded delicious. We decided to get a plate of meats and cheeses as well as some small plates so we could try more things. 

Our charcuterie and cheeses included Serrano ham, wild boar salume, a soft cow milk cheese, a firm sheep milk cheese, and a Roquefort blue cheese. Everything was great but I was confused by the varying portions. We had lots of meat but the cheese pieces were tiny. Also the cheese portions varied. We got a slight larger piece of Roquefort and a micro piece of cow milk. Not sure why. 

As for the small plates we ordered the tuna tartar, grilled octopus, and sweetbreads. The tuna is served on a piece of crispy seaweed. There are three servings stacked on top of each other. The tuna was fresh but it was cubed like an Ahi poke. I felt it could use a touch of citrus to give it a little flavor. 

The grilled octopus is served with dressed greens and a garlic aioli (which was served on the side due to my fiancé's egg allergy).  Honestly the aioli was good but I do not think the dish needs it. The octopus was tender and juicy with slight charring. It was full of flavor and I wanted more. Also the bright greens went perfect with the savory octopod.

Lastly the sweetbreads. I happen to love sweetbreads but I know a lot of people are tepid to try it. I would suggest to those wanting to try it to get them here. They were in fact a little sweet due to a glaze. They were also buttery and not musty at all. It's also served over a creamy polenta that I nearly sopped up with my finger.

The food was delicious, as was the wine.  We ordered the Vietnamese Wagyu Beef Carpaccio and the Potato Gnocchi to start.  Both were phenomenal.  I loved the deep and complex flavors of the beef carpaccio and the potato gnocchi was so warm and comforting.  They were both delicious.  Extremely different tastes, but both executed very well.  I think definitely the appetizers were our highlights of the meal.

For dessert, we ordered the chocolate hazelnut cake with espresso syrup because I can't deny anything espresso-flavored.  It was really dense though so it was hard to really finish it.  Good, but maybe a bit overwhelming.

Service was good and our waiter also suggested a nice wine for me.  I would love to have tried some more of their wine offerings and cheese & charcuterie.

Only weird point in the night was when I decided to use the restroom and realized that the toilet was made of steel.  I didn't think much of it at first--figured they were going for a modern look and it's probably easier to clean.  But, then I realized why I felt so uncomfortable in their spacious bathroom--it reminded me of disgusting cramped airplane bathrooms which always have those metal toilets!  Maybe this was overlooked in the design process?

I heard lunch wasn't all that great, but dinner surpassed my expectations;  had an awesome experience! The service was excellent and the venue was just as neat.

I came with three other people, so the four of us were able to try and good portion of the menu. Can't complain about anything, except for maybe the 6 cheese that we ordered. They were very sharp! 

For starters, we tried their Chef's Full Charcuterie Board, Ahi Tuna Tartare with Crispy Nori Tempura, Pan Roasted Hudson Valley Foie Gras, and Spicy Little Meatballs.
--Everything was great!

Main entree: 
I ordered the Roasted Long Island Duck Breast, which was grilled to perfection; so good.
I also tried my friends' main courses and they were just as good:
 Sautéed Lamb Chops with Ragout of Farro & Lamb Shoulder, Roasted Wild Alaskan Halibut, and Grilled Berkshire Pork Chop. 
--All of the meat were very cooked really well. They were tender and infused with flavors. 

Dessert:
--by dessert, we were all full and only I had ordered something.
--Warm Chocolate Hazelnut Cake with gianduja gelato+ espresso sauce


The bar, lets not forget that: This place seems like a good choice for a low-key night with the bar and their extensive list of wine selection. The wine menu was incredible!

The restaurant takes it name from the origins of its owner, Mark Kuller, a prominent US Treasury tax lawyer and wine aficionado. After years of dreaming, Kuller's vision of opening a wine centric DC restaurant was born. Featuring over 30 by the glass selections and over 1,000 bottles for true wine nerds, Proof is a wine lover's paradise. 

And now the food:

Meridian Hill, Four Roses Bourbon, La Gitana Manzanilla Sherry, Honey Syrup, Lemon Juice & Grapefruit Bitters 14. Fantastic and refreshing cocktail to start the evening. 

Pan Roasted Hudson Valley Foie Gras. 
Sweet cherry short cake, pistachio, cocoa nibs, bing cherry jus $19. The combination here was truly heroic. I loved the coca nibs, it was certainly second to none and the foie gras itself was nicely done as well. 

Gumbo of Shrimp, Oysters, Blue Crab & Andouille Sausage onions, peppers, celery, sassafras, rice, parsley, scallions 15. The gumbo here was especially tasty, not especially spicy either. Perfectly prepared in my opinion and served with an adequate presentation. Nothing like the foie gras though. 

Sautéed Lamb Chops with Ragout of Farro & Lamb Shoulder pistachios, dried apricots, whipped yogurt, almonds, sumac $35. The lamb chops were the highlight of the evening. Sweet and tender, I cleaned my plate in no time. The farro (various grains of wheat) was nice and chewy. I don't like it too soft so it was a nice contrast to the lamb. The creamy white yogurt provided a nice dipping condiment for the lamb. 

Crispy Spiced Panko Crusted Organic Chicken Breast fragrant basmati rice, kohlrabi slaw, gingered tomato fondue, cilantro $26. The crusted chicken was a nice variation on chicken breasts and rice. The slaw was excellent and the choice of the tomato fondue mixed well with the chicken. 

Sticky Toffee Pudding Cake, almond streusel, vanilla ice cream $10. Known as Proof's most popular dessert, I can see why. Our waiter told us that when it goes off the menu people clamor for it for months until it comes back on. Delicious toffee pudding that slides down so well with the vanilla ice cream garnished with mint leaves. Absolutely orgasmic. 

Of Note: Proof features a lovely al fresco dining area. It is of note however that it is rumored to be bothersome by panhandlers passing by on the street (according to Yelp reviews). 

Entrance to Proof. Immediately apparent is the marriage of food and wine here at Proof. In fact, I will say I think the wine selection outshines the excellent food offerings here. 

A well kept charcuterie and cheese station is kept adjacent to the dining area. 

My traditional restroom review: Now I understood why I didn't see anyone under 30 in the crowd in the dining room tonight. I can only imagine what the ladies restroom looks like. Certainly would not take a child in here. Despite the questionable nature of the decor, the sinks were freakin awesome and I want some like that in my house. Have to be careful about splashing through. Ultra modern, ultra cool. Me want.

For me, it's rare that food takes a back seat to anything, but Proof's wine list is stunning. Not that I could afford them, but I have never seen so many California cult wines on one menu. My co-workers all enjoyed their entrees (the duck and pork chops, I think) and the charcuterie was very good. 

The ambiance was a little awkward, but not due to Proof. We ate outside and 3 panhandlers approached us during the meal. One woman was weeping as she asked for money and another man came twice to our table and was very aggressive, staying for minutes at a time and belittling people at the table. You can't really fault the restaurant or the panhandlers, but it certainly made everyone feel terrible. Service was not overtly enthusiastic but I give our server points for handling the gentleman who interrupted our meal in a low-key and sensitive manner.

I had the cherry to tart with pistachio ice cream for dessert and she had the sticky pudding. Both were great but had the same problem: ice cream to dessert ratio was off. Both needed more ice cream.

The restaurant is located in Chinatown, right by the Verizon Center, but it definitely does not have the hustle and bustle that usually surrounds the typical Chinatown restaurants.  The restaurant was full, but still intimate. 

We shared a bottle of Riesling, Forge Cellars, Finger Lakes, New York.  For the charcuterie, we got the Finocchiona, which was a fennel scented pork salume.  It was great and the perfect portion for us, about 7 slices.  For cheese, we ordered a place of 3 for $13.  

Our cheese: 
Cow - St. Andrew, buttery and rich
Goat - Cypress Grove Humboldt Fog, semi-soft, creamy, herby
Blue - Black River Blue, creamy and earthy 

All 3 were amazing - came with spreads and crostini.  

For our entrees, I got the seared scallops wit cauliflower puree, which was so amazing.  The scallops were seared perfectly and the puree was so creamy.  I love cauliflower puree!  The BF got the lamb chops which came with a risotto and yogurt sauce.  The lamb was tender and the risotto was relish.  The sauce complimented the lamb perfectly. 

Dessert was the only part of my meal that wasn't amazing.  I got the strawberry-rhubarb cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  It was good, but based on the rest of the meal, I was expecting more.

I could easily survive off these three staples for days on end - and have actually done so in the past and lived to tell about it. In the end, if you are what you eat, I'd much rather be something gluttonous and delicious than a freakin' carrot.  

Food: Proof is a contemporary American restaurant with an extensive international selection of cheese, charcuterie, and wine, including Rhone varietals, Bordeaux classics, and domestic favorites. Wines are available by the half glass, full glass, half bottle, and full bottle. During my visit, we started with the sautéed potato gnocchi and the goat cheese with clover honey, both of which were excellent. For an entree, I had the crispy spiced panko crusted chicken, which was perfectly cooked and packed with flavor - it was served atop basmati rice with gingered tomato fondue, which had a nice kick to it. We  opted to forego dessert, but the options were varied and enticing. 

Service: Our water was very personable, knowledgable about the menu, and eager to accommodate - there were two individuals in our party with food allergies and he was extremely understanding and went out of his way to identify which menu items should be avoided. However, I will say that the wait time for the food to be delivered was excruciatingly long, despite the fact that the restaurant was at no more than 50% capacity during our visit - our entrees were served well over an hour after being ordered. 

Atmosphere: Proof is tastefully decorated with wood accents throughout - there's a small bar area immediately upon entry and the rest of the restaurant is dedicated to booth and table seating. Above the bar are a series of TV's that feature images from the collection of the nearby National Portrait Gallery and Smithsonian's American Art Museum. One aspect of the dining experience that was bit unsettling was the height of the booths - the seats were so low relative to the table height that I could only see the heads of my dinner companions across the table. Moreover, by the time I left, I felt like I needed the assistance of a physical therapist after literally having my arms propped above my head to eat - and I'm 5'10! 

Cost: Moderately pricey, but consistent with the area. Appetizers are $12-$19, entrees are $24-$31, sides are $10, and desserts are $8-$10. Charcuterie are $6-$20 and cheeses are three/$13 and six/$25. 

Other: Proof is located at the corner of 9th and G Streets - just a few steps from the Gallery Place/Chinatown metro station. Happy your specials are offered Monday-Friday from 5:30PM to 7PM, including $5 glasses of house wine, $8 classic cocktails, and other discounted wines and beers. Proof is closed for lunch on Mondays. Valet parking is available for dinner only ($12). Corckage fee is $40 (two bottle maximum).

The ""Plate of House Made Pates & Terrines"" is one of the best menu items I have ever had in DC, hands down. You get terrines, foie, and pates of varying flavors and textures. At the same price as my aforementioned cocktail, it's a great deal. I ordered the Colorado lamb loin to really saturate my night with saturated fats. Hi. Bye. I die. It was so good. Perfectly cooked. Perfectly spiced. Perfectly paired with lentils and coriander yogurt.

Proof is a place where everything on the menu sounds incredibly enticing. Needless to say, I am dying to go back. But next time around I'll probably skip the pre-dinner cocktail... and maybe order two entrees instead.

1750,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=PJwCCsJyLCOu-LXQHYMx1Q,"I stopped here for dinner on a whim after finishing my errands. Initially, when I arrived I asked if I could sit outside and the hostess replied, ""how many?"" and I replied, ""just me!"" I was wearing street clothes so I think they were skeptical about my ability to pay for dinner. I thought that since it's in a fairly touristy area that they wouldn't comment on attire since there are plenty of tourists with even less formal clothing going in. They didn't turn me away which was nice because there was no one sitting outside and I thought that was fantastic! 

The funny of the night was a kid off the street ran to the chair opposite me and sat there for a few minutes as his friends cheered. The staff were very worried I would be scared or offended but I just took it in stride. I was having a bad day and so this diversion just made me laugh. 

Other than that, the server was really kind and recommended wines to me and the other staff kept my water glass full. To start, I had prosecco and ordered the ahi tuna which was delicious but I didn't think there was a good nori/avocado ratio to tuna. I ended up with more tuna which ultimately isn't a negative--I'm just weird about eating foods in equal portions. 

For my main dish, I had house made noodles and chanterelle mushrooms and corn. The salty and sweet combo was delicious and the cheese complimented the meal without overwhelming. I had my server surprise me with a new drink and he brought me a flight of white wines. They were so similar in taste that I was sure they were all the same wine at one point. 

I didn't finish my main dish because I was thinking about having Madeira but because I picked the sticky toffee cake my server suggested a lighter dessert wine which was really lovely. The cake with the dessert wine was just the best close to the evening. My server plied me with one more drink as an apology for the dinner interruption which I accepted.

During dinner I was reading a book every now and again and by that point I was very full and wanted more peaceful surroundings.  I knew the nightlife was a bit rowdy but I didn't expect things to be as they were. Despite all the potential issues, the staff at Proof were thoroughly professional, made me feel welcome and cared for, and of course served excellent food.

If I were on a date or with friends I would definitely sit inside to avoid the street noise.

1756,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=vseo0-45KWnXZAOiLbg4TQ,"For Zach's birthday, I wanted to take him somewhere special that wasn't too expensive and was still in close proximity to the theater we were going to later. After hearing such great things about Proof over the years, we had talked about trying it out sometime and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. Even more than its cuisine, Proof is known for its outstanding wine selection boasting 1,000 different bottles and over 40 by-the-glass selections. Led by Chef Haidar Karoum, the cuisine is also known to be stupendous.

On this particular Saturday night, we had an early 5:30 p.m. reservation so we'd be sure to make the theater on time for the show.  As soon as we sat down, we were handed the wine selection. This 50-page book was very overwhelming showcasing wines from the New and Old World. We spent about 20 minutes just trying to decide on a bottle and eventually chose the Bergstrom Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir (2009) from Willamette Valley, which we absolutely loved.

Proof has a great selection of modern American cuisine, but only offers one vegan entree. I knew this coming in and had contacted the chef ahead of time to see what our options would be as far as appetizers and sides. He said that the salad of local frisee, roasted beets salad, and butter crunch lettuce salad could all be made vegan. They would also be able to change the vinaigrettes to avoid the honey. Additionally, three of the sides -- the grilled ramps, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli, could be made vegan. So, I felt comfortable knowing there were some options.

They started out by serving some bread with some sort of dairy sauce. One bread was not vegan, but the flatbread was so I ate the crispy flatbread while deciding what to order.

Zach wanted to order the vegetarian gnocchi, which was not vegan, so I started with the tempura instead.  Tempura is not that exciting as you can find it anywhere, but I found this tempura to be particularly good. There were wild mushrooms, French beans, red peppers, asparagus, and eggplant all cooked to perfection in tempura batter. But, it was really the sauce that brought the flavors out. The lemon-truffle dipping sauce made with daikon radish really brought out the flavors of the vegetables. The wild mushrooms, in particular, were amazing.

As we were waiting for our entrees to come out, I admired the decor.  On one side of the restaurant, there was an exposed brick wall on which gold framed mirrors were hung. Along the wall were large booths and throughout the restaurant there was ample seating for patrons. There was an amusing sign leading to the restrooms that illustrated a man peeking over the stall at a woman that Zach found disturbing. I found it to be quite funny.

At the bar, I noticed that all of the wine bottles were kept refrigerated in a a stainless steel Enomatic machine from Italy that allowed the staff to dispense wine into a glass without removing the bottle from the refrigerated area. It was very cool. On the screens above the bar, Proof pays homage to the Portrait Gallery across the street by displaying images from the museum's collection on flat-screen plasma monitors.

After a little bit of time, our entrees were served. We both ordered the Napolean as that is the only vegan item on the menu. It consisted of vegetables sandwiched between two layers of crispy fried tofu and topped with crispy mushrooms.  The tofu was firm and elegantly prepared so much so that I inquired as to how it got its consistency. I was told it was pressed, then vacuum sealed to get all the water and air out. Interesting. The broccoli, bok choy, and carrots were steamed while the Hen of the Woods mushrooms were fried to a crisp. It was topped with a sweet chili-garlic sauce. This dish was very good.

But, while the entree was very good, it certainly wasn't mind-blowing, which is really what I was expecting from Proof. Everything we had had an Asian twist, which really isn't novel in the vegan world. We inquired as to whether they were considering adding more vegan options and it didn't sound like they were as there are only eight entrees on the menu and apparently only one can be vegan.

All in all, the service was spectacular, the wine was exquisite, and the food was good. Next time, we may just come for drinks and appetizers though.  The meal itself with wine was pricey -- in the end we paid over $200 including tip. If I am going to spend that kind of money, I can think of a few other places in the city I'd rather go. That said, I'm glad we went to experience Proof and certainly enjoyed the experience.  If they were to offer a new vegan entree at some point, we would definitely return.

Cons: My only recommendation is to NOT sit outside. It's Chinatown, which attracts some weird people. Homeless people and tourists WILL walk by your table and stare at you while you eat. In hindsight, I would have opted to sit inside. (minus one star, since I love to sit outside)

He fancied the terrine-filled menu while I just liked the fact that Proof had won some recognition from local press. Given our high expectations, there were bound to be some disappointments; however, I think my impressions wouldn't have been much different had I entered the classy Chinatown restaurant knowing nothing of its reputation. 

The space, as you might have seen if you've passed by before, is quite nice-modern with wine bottles everywhere. There is a good ratio of servers to diners, guaranteeing everyone receives good service and gets what they need/want in a timely manner. 

I barely noticed my surroundings though because I was more interested in the menu. As a team, we chose  four ""firsts"" to share and then he also got himself a dessert. 

Items that caught our eye:
gravlax
gnocchi with hen of the woods mushrooms
chilled garlic soup with shrimp
escarole salad with sardines

The highlights of our savory picks were the gnocchi and gravlax, the last two items to arrive (table for two is too small to accommodate all dishes at once). The gnocchi, for being a small plates offering, was plentiful and tasty thanks to the always winning combo of peas, mushrooms, parsley, and fresh butter. Proof's deconstruction of smoked salmon, cream cheese, and capers was also very flavorful and easy on the eyes. Proof definitely puts forth some beautiful plates, phenomenal plating. The slivers of fish resembled reddish-orange jewels and went well with the equally thin coins of potato, bits of caper, and sour cream.

The chilled garlic soup with poached shrimp was also quite good, and I would argue that it probably was the most creative dish as it required the chef to coax a lot of other flavors out of the garlic and to form it into a vichyssoise-like soup. The shrimp complemented the rich broth nicely. 

The not-so-winning combo was the escarole salad with sardines, basically a gussied-up version of Caesar salad. The ingredients were fresh and luxurious on their own; however, they didn't work well together to form one cohesive dish. I had almost no desire to get the greens, fish, tomatoes, and hard-boiled onto my fork at once. Instead, I had a bite of the egg, a nibble of the salad...

I'm giving Proof four stars for great service, gorgeous presentation, lovely ingredients, and a clear passion for food. However, I think their renditions of everyday food aren't as memorable as some other places I've tried recently. I want a little more creativity and something in each plate to really jump out at me. There's no denying, however, that Proof is still one of the best choices for dining/drinking in the heart of the city.

I was fortunate that everyone of them I went to was great. This was one of my favorites - but, also the most expensive (though in reality it doesn't have to be --- more on that in a bit).This one has a nice location next to what remains of Chinatown for people watching and strolling after dinner. 

I started at their bar thinking I would grab one of their spectacular concoctions at their reasonable happy hour price - but, it was very busy and a pretty patio outside on a nice evening was calling my name. (Patios like me and vice-versa.) My service was absolutely exceptional and I went whole hog - or in this case, whole duck - with a ducky meal of foie gras to start and Roasted Long island duck for the main course. Yes, it was decadently rich,  But, I was in a ducky mood - and since both were phenomenal - I'm not sure if I would in retrospect trade one in for something else.  

Foie Gras - If you are a foie gras lover, it's a must - not only perfectly cooked and delicious, but served in  a way that looks like an art piece (someone else posted a pic of it - so I won't repeat).  Waiter reco'd a glass of sauterne dessert wine to accompany it. Went perfectly.  Honestly, wish I'd had this as the second course- because it makes a perfect savory desert - and i had no room left for the richness of a dessert after this meal.

On to Duck course two: Highly, highly recommended. Great flavor, well cooked, One nitpik - I love grits, but the blueberries and drippings turned these into a sort of soup at the bottom of the plate.  Not sure that's really what was intended.  Still, I'd get it again.  Also went with the servers reco for a nice red wine.  These people know their wine and he provided me options without trying to sell me the most expensive item on the list.

Comes with  crispy, flavorful cracker like bread served with a refreshing greek-yogurt like sauce (and I was in need of the refreshing from all the other richness going on)

So, it was an expensive meal ($75+) for one person when all was said and done.  Yet, I saw many, if not most, folks on the patio hanging out with friends or dates after work sharing bottles of wine and beautiful looking charcuterie boards.  This is a more reasonable way to go.

Bottom Line: This is one for service, food and atmosphere that I'd leave on my DC ""to do list"" if looking for a fine dining or looking for a nice patio or cocktail experience. Will definitely revisit when I'm back.

Great cocktails, super extensive wine list, great service, and great food.  They have one of the better cheese and charcuterie menus in the city. For all you pig lovers, I highly recommend the crispy pigs head appetizer.  For my main course, I had a semi-deconstructed cassoulet, where almost every aspect of the dish, from all the different meats to the sauce, was interesting and excellent.  My one complaint of the meal, however, was that the beans were just slightly undercooked.  There were no complaints from anyone else about their entrees though.

Although I had a very good full dining experience here, I think this venue would be BEST enjoyed by sharing some small plates over wine or cocktails...

Favorite things (besides the dark/swanky/sophisticated decor and cozy feel) were the charcuterie and cheese selections. 

I had the prosciutto and a French blue cheese as appetizers and they were both delightful. The cheese was served on a plate with some dates, honey and toasted bread which complemented that particular cheese I had masterfully.

The crispy pig's head appetizer, which *sounds* soooo good and seems to be quite popular, I would skip. Very disappointed in this. Tasted like chicken mcnuggets, honestly.

If there were ever perfection on a plate as it concerned a piece of fish,  it could be the sablefish entree here. omg. Melt in your mouth. A real testament to a skilled chef here.

Halibut/curry entree was also very good.

Service was notably good/attentive. 

Cocktail, glass of wine, cheese, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees at $125 translates into a good value for my experience here. Solid.

It is a ""nice"" restaurant, so prepared to pay those kinds of prices. And, although this is a spectacular restaurant, and one which I wholeheartedly recommend, it doesn't have that extra X-factor to warrant it a 5-star recipient. 

One aspect that sets Proof apart from other super-nice DC restaurants is that it has a superior selection of charcuterie and cheeses. We're talking high-grade, richly flavored and textured and fragrant cheeses (offering from goat, sheep, cow, and blue fromages). Sample three or six on a plate (and the accompanying flat bread is pretty dynamite as well). The L'Amuse Gouda is to die for. 

The appetizers (firsts) are all equally alluring. The two I've sampled are the spiced butternut squash soup (um...YUM) and the spicy little meatballs (which are, indeed, spicy). They also offer sweetbreads for those with a little more culinary daring than I have... 

For main courses, I'd stick to the fish (although a friend had the Peking duck and raved). I loved the scallops - light and fresh - paired with squash and gnocchi for more substance. Could have done with a bit more flavor, though. My husband was pretty pleased with the Alaskan sable fish. 

If you come here for dinner, you might as well go all out and spend the extra several hundred calories on one of their dessert offerings (because chocolate at the end of a great meal is always a good idea). 

Wine - excellent and often updated selection, to satisfy a range of budgets (you know, even you with an extra couple thousand bucks to spend on a bottle of red, bottle of white...) The wine list, truth be told, is pretty overwhelming, so don't hesitate to ask your server for recommendations to fit your budget and tastes.

I have to say this display of charcuterie is among the very best we have had the pleasure of enjoying. I only wish they had included something sweet alongside the mustard condiment, like a honey or apricot spread to balance the plate just slightly more than what they had. If you love Italian meats and cheeses, you will love this place. 

The pork confit was a bit dry, but still tasty. It was accompanied by a grapefruit reduction that was a pleasant compliment to the glazed pork.

We recommend the spicy meat balls - the pasta with goat cheese that comes with it is SO GOOD!!

Highly recommend the Mencia Blend ( Luna Beberide, Castilla y Lean) red wine from Spain. My husband really enjoyed the beer called Backwoods Bastard bourbon ale from Michigan. Both very nice, and perfect with the spicy, smoky flavors of the charcuterie (meats).

We were a walk in, and per our calls to the Restaurant I was not confident we would even be seated.  After hanging out at the bar for a bit I figured we would end up at the Greek place around the corner -- Zaytinya (also very highly rated).  But after about 20 mins we were seated.  

We ordered both the selection pates & terrines and selection of pickles + the iberico ham (because I'm a maniac about iberico ham when i can find it).  Normally I hate pickled stuff, but my gfriend was right on -- you really need to have the pickle selection with the other plate.  They go *wonderfully* together.  The fennel especially goes well with the various pates.  I really cant recommend these two dishes together enough.  It was one of the highlights of the meal.  The duck liver mousse was especially good if your not up for trying the other ones.  Iberico ham?  Well yeah it was the bomb, as you would expect -- though probably not worth the price (as you would also expect).

Next was the second course, and we opted for the rabbit sausage and roasted beets.  The salad was very good (even though I am not a fan of beets) and honestly the rabbit sausage was just decent, nothing to be excited about.  Again, not bad, but not exceptional either.  The salad (with the beets), to my surprise, was quite good.  Very light, yet flavorful dressing and proportional am out of goat cheese.  The rabbit sausage wasn't bad, but was just a bit flat, and the lentils were a bit overpowering on their own.  With the sausage it was alright, but overall the dish just wasn't something I would recommend.  Sick with the beet salad.

Finally, our main course was the Peking duck breast and spaghetti and meatballs.  Now your probably thinking the same as me --- spaghetti and meatballs, that's pretty damn boring --  but let me tell you, this dish was not what you would expect.  Per the menu, the meatballs are made of foie gras, beef and pork.  And wow. -- its pretty amazing.  Over it is a great red sauce complete with carrots and an angel hair pasta.  Delicious.  Seriously the best thing we had short of the pates and terrine dish (and its debatable which was better).  The Peking duck was quite good, but just not anywhere near the flavor of the spaghetti and meatballs.  I think her duck was a bit overcooked too, to be honest.  I wish we would have ordered the cassoluet...

As far as the decor and service, its about what you would expect -- pretty intimate seating, not too close to other tables, and dimly lit with the music volume being about where it should.  Romantic, classy, etc.  Service is pretty good.

Al in all, this place was really top notch, and I would come back here in a second.   I think when I come back and know how to order a little better (casoluet), it might be a 5 star experience.

The place picked up as the night went on, but it wasn't as crowded as I had expected. We had reservations, but we could have done without.

I ordered the tuna first and the tofu second. Both were excellent. Everything came out looking like art on a plate and it was all delicious. The tuna was very fresh and it tasted like one big sushi roll. The tofu was tasty, although I think it was a bit heavy on the soy sauce. I was craving water for the rest of the night. -- but it was delicious.

My boyfriend ordered the pigs head first, which may have been the best thing we ordered between the two of us. It was super tasty. And then he had the squid  pasta, which was also good, but he was still hungry when he finished his plate. 

The portions aren't huge... we went to a show at the Shakespeare Theatre and we both came out quite hungry two hours later. Its kinda sad that we were hungry after having spent over $100 for dinner at Proof. We ended up going to Gordon Biersch afterwards for dessert (where we devoured a yummy brownie sundae). 

We actually ordered dessert at Proof too, and it was good, but it wasn't WOW good. We had the bread pudding with banana ice cream. I would skip dessert at Proof and grab dessert elsewhere. 

I promise we're not pigs. We are pretty fit and tend to eat relatively healthy. We don't usually eat dessert when we go out, so the fact that we had TWO in one night gives you an idea of how the food wasn't especially filling.

The burger was well cooked and comes on a well buttered brioche bun, and is accompanied with tzatziki sauce.  On the plate is a pile of chickpea fries, which I was at first cautious of, but they turned out to be tasty and excellent, topped with some interesting flavors.  The burger was juicy and delicious, and went well with the accompanying jalapeno mayo, which I thought formed a nice synergy with the crispness of the cucumber tzatziki.  

Overall, the lunch was good, borderline great.  I'd like to come here for dinner and try out a full entree as some of the options on the menu seem very intriguing.

Food: We were celebrating our first anniversary so we really went all out and ordered every single course (something we usually don't do.)
Charcuterie: prosciutto & bresacola, a very generous portion of both came with bread drizzled with olive oil - though i liked it best by itself. Both were very flavorful and tender
Mushroom Bisque: I'm salivating just thinking about it. The flavor was creamy, buttery, mushroomy goodness - it's hard to describe this any other way but perfect.
Fresh mozzarella & tomato salad: the cheese was great and tomatoes did the trick, my only complaint was slightly too much dressing for my liking.
Steak w/mushrooms & fingerling potatoes: Unfortunately, this was the low part of the meal. The potatoes and mushrooms were cooked and seasoned well, but I was disappointed by the steak. I love my steak pink (which it was) with a good, crusty sear - that's what it didn't have. If it had had a good sear, it would have been perfect.
Sticky toffee cake - this was probably one of my favorite courses of the whole meal. It had a wonderful caramel, butter flavor and almost melted in your mouth. Since it was our anniversary, they brought us a glass of Madeira to pair with it - perfect!

Drinks: The wine menu is kind of intimidating. Since my husband doesn't usually drink wine, we went with an easy to drink white. It was closer to the cheaper end of the spectrum (maybe $60?) but prices skyrocket into the hundreds. Next time, I'll go with someone who really knows their wine. 

Service: Our server gave us the space to make decisions, and spend time together but was always there when we needed something.

Atmosphere: It's kind of a romantic vibe, and we were dressed up so it was a nice evening. There were other people who appeared to have wandered in off the street but... I don't know about you, I'm not going to pay more than $250 for a meal when I'm wearing a tshirt and jeans.

The spicy little meatball was great: good portion and tasty!  The mushroom quiche and the potato gnocchi were just fine (nothing extraordinary but decent).  Ended the meal with the chocolate bread pudding.  That was delicious!!!  It was warm and moist, and the raspberry sauce complimented the bread pudding very nicely.  Yum!!!

We had a nice table and I did not feel like the people who were sat next to us were right on top of us which is nice. 

To start my date had the Haidar's Day Off cocktail. It was named for the chef and it was very good. It had gin and prosecco which sounds odd but the bubbles gave it a nice light taste. I had a dirty vodka martini which was good sized but could have been a bit stronger.

To start we shared the spicy meatballs, tuna tartare, and the gnocchi.

Tuna tartare is a must if you go. It was absolutely excellent and had great flavor and spice.

The meatballs were also good but not as spicy as I would have liked. The ravioli they were served with were good.

I did not care for the gnocchi as I thought it was a bit to chewy but my date liked it. I would not order it again.

For dinner I had the hangar steak cooked medium with no mushrooms. It was excellent. The meat was cooked perfectly and was very tender and flavorful. The bacon was great and the artichokes added a good unique flavor to the dish. I would recommend this.

My date had the striped bass over summer vegetables. The fish was a little bit bland but was cooked well. The vegetables tasted fresh and were very good. It was a fine dish but she would not order it again.

We skipped desert but they brought me a single scoop of vanilla ice cream with a candle and two glasses of desert wine on the house. It was a nice touch.

With our appetizer and entrees we each had glass of the California Sauvignon Blanc and then with dinner I had a glass of the house cab. They were all very nice but seemed pricey at $15, especially as the only option. Those prices are pushing BLT, J&G etc which I think Proof is just a step below.

The services was solid overall. When our waiter was busy with a large group the manager came over to ask us if we needed anything and promptly brought us two glasses of wine. It is nice when management cares about the experience of all customers.

The fish was light, fresh and excellent, but not over the top wow.  I could've really done without the noodles.... I couldn't even begin to tell you how it tasted.  Mediocre at best?  No complaints from me though, because the fish was done well and I'll leave it at that.

Very smooth to the core.  I am a wine junkie, and I definitely mark Proof as being a great wine bar.

Their dessert was freaking amazing. I don't know what they were all called but it was yummy!!!!!  All light (non-chocolate) but probably safe to say not light on calories.  I assume the peanut brittle was homemade, it went very well with the banana bread pudding.

The generous portion of thinly sliced Spanish ham with toasted bread was exquisite and makes me want to return to sample more of the extensive chacuterie. The fish entries were excellent - a rock bass and halibut perfectly cooked.  Portions could have been a little larger.

I liked the wine selections and the ability to order a small or large glass. Only small complaint was they were out of a $5 beer and shifted us to an $6 brew. I'm not going to pitch a fit about a three $ bump, but perhaps it should be mentioned.

This restaurant clearly sweated the details on the ambiance.  From the moment you walk in, you feel like you're in a good and extremely expensive restaurant.  And that's because you are.

Food-- the appetizers were solidly good.  The Tuna Tartare was good, but more avocado would have added the last dimension that was sort of lacking.  The Entrees were excellent.  I had the duck breast with yam puree, and it was perfectly cooked and the puree paired nicely with the duck-- there was just a tinge of an earthy note, and it sealed the dish pretty well.  My co-diners also enjoyed their entrees as well (tofu salad, and Atlantic salmon).  Desserts were good-- Proof cookie plate was a great mix of sweet and semi-sweet cookies and other confections, tiramisu was fresh and not overly sweet, which is very good.

Drinks-- Good wines available by the glass, but pricey.  A glass of wine that would be $7-10 anywhere else in D.C. was $12-15 here.  House cocktails were slightly uninspiring-- skip them and just order your favorite drink.

Service-- Our waitress was very good, food came out at just the right time and at a good temperature.  The busboys were odd-- even though we weren't actively eating, they picked up the appetizer plates that still had food on them (i.e., we were going to eat that).  Also, they were VERY quick to bus the table, when it would have been nice to sit with our empty plates and enjoy the conversation for a bit before they cleared the table.

Price-- This restaurant, while very good, is a bit on the pricey side.  All entrees are $24-32, which is probably four or five dollars over what it should be.  It's a good restaurant, but come on.  On the other hand, it was very casual, which I also appreciated.

Overall-- A really enjoyable evening, a great ambiance, wonderful food, and good company.

The wine list was huge but they also have many choices by the glass so you can indulge your inner oenophile  while not having to take out a second mortgage.  This was a birthday celebration for my wife our reservations were at 8 pm and we met her sister and husband at the restaurant.  The hostess was gracious and wished my wife a happy birthday. We never felt rushed and in fact were ""that"" table who left around midnight. 

The food was spot on!  We started with the Spicy Meatballs with Goats Cheese Angolotti, Duck Confit with Scallion Hush Puppies and the Tuna Tartar.  Tuna has become the ""chicken"" of most menu's it is safe and nothing that  really says ""wow""!!  However the Nori ""crackers"" were fun and whimsical.  The Duck was slow cooked to damn near perfection and I loved the pickled Beech Mushrooms.  The meatballs were good, but the angolotti was perfect.  I really wanted to go for the Pigs head, Foie Gras and Sweetbreads, but our dinner companions were a little more ""meat and potatoes"".  This was fine with me as both preparation and presentation were attractive but not over the top.

For the entrees we had:
Pan Roasted Wild Alaskan Halibut
sautéed escarole, fennel, kalamata olives, sauce antiboise, smoky eggplant crostini

Grilled Flat Iron Steak with King Trumpet Mushrooms
cippolini onions, roasted fingerlings, bordelaise sauce

Roasted Colorado Lamb Loin
rustic tomato and bread salad, bagna cauda, crispy onions

All of which are based in the classics, however the Chef's fusion of late 90's Mediterranean  flavors was well executed.  The Halibut was perfectly seared and the Provencal flavors are a personal favorite.  The smoky Eggplant Crostini was an understated Baba Ghanoush and the Panzanella salad with lamb has always been a personal favorite when cooking.  The Flat Iron Steak is a great crowd pleaser for the masses.  My only constructive criticism would be that nothing here really pushed the envelope. 1) It was all very ""safe"" classical comfort foods with the Chef's twist.  They are not setting the world on fire here, but they are executing what they do very well. 2) Our servers timing on dessert was a little off as both female parties had step away to the ladies room when they served dessert.

On the last day of my three day class, I was bound and determined to have the famous shrimp burger.  I hurriedly made my way just after they opened and managed to snag two seats at the bar (they go quickly).  I was not able to enjoy wine that afternoon, so I had water and a iced tea instead.  

Now down to the burger.  When it arrived, it was a thing of beauty.  It just looked perfect.  That first bite was something to be savored; the texture was almost crisp and the inside was lightly chewy.  All I can say is that it was shrimpy goodness and the combination of the salty and the sweet, tangy pickled veggies is out of this world.  I'm normally a slow eater, but on this day, I think I plowed through my meal because it was soooooooo good.  

Service was rather impersonal...guy took our order, brought it to us, and when we were done we had to ask for the check (we were sitting at the bar right in front of him, not around the corner and out of sight).   I did mention that we were tight on time when we sat down at the bar, so he might have forgotten that bit of information and figured we were having a leisurely lunch.

Since we were celebrating, they comp'ed us each a glass of champagne, which was very nice.  Service was very attentive and so nice.  We sat and took our time ordering various courses and alcohol, and they did not rush us at all.  The sommelier was great and when I explained what I wanted, he picked out a very tasty, perfect malbec.  

The food was quite tasty as well.  We basically just did small plates.  The wild boar salami was quite flavorful.  The goat cheese with honey is incredible - it is even better than you think it will be!  The pate campagne was also delicious.  I'm not a big fan of pate generally, but I couldn't get enough of it.  The tuna tartare was, in my opinion, a little boring and didn't have much flavor - I know I've seen a lot of reviews raving about it, but I wasn't impressed.  The sweetbreads were very good but again lacking a bit in flavor.  The gnocchi....holy cow, that gnocchi was so good!  I'm still thinking about it today - I would most certainly recommend the gnocchi.  For dessert (at my insistence) we got the warm chocolate hazelnut cake.  It was honestly quite tasty - but it wasn't very warm, so I was slightly disappointed.  Still incredibly tasty though!  Also, the presentation on everything was really nice.

Additionally, the focus on presentation and local, farm-fresh ingredients makes you feel like you're getting something for your money instead of secretly thinking you could recreate restaurant food at home.

The duck confit ""first"" has so much flavor, and could very well be as large as an entree. My only challenge with it is that it was overcooked a bit (heat lamp maybe?) and crosses the line from confit ""falling off the bone"" to basically being roasted.  

The burrata first is also an excellent choice; it's an excellent blend of gooey cheese and crunchy vegetables.  It could have used a little more balsamic for flavor instead of just a drizzle for plate decoration.

Having had the duck entree in the past, I will also comment that it's superb. Back then I was watching portion size (who was I kidding, really) and ordered a box with my entree to pack half of it up, and yeah, I ended up giving the box back because I ate the whole thing. Whether that speaks of the food quality or my insatiable appetite is yours to decide.

My companions raved about their branzino entrees, but for the cost I found the portion size to be a little small.  The beet salad, served with surprising slices of blue cheese, was about as delicious as beets can be in a roasted format.

So now you're asking: why 4 stars when this person clearly likes to stuff her face full of Proof's food?  The answer is that it is SLOW. Like tasting menu slow, but for a beet salad.

But due to the fact that it was a treat and I didn't have to pay I gave it 4.  I'll be sure to update this the next time since I'm sure I'll have to lay the money down.

So Proof--It's located right in the Gallery Place/Chinatown area right across the street from the Verizon Center. I was meeting a group from work for lunch and I realized I've walked right by it many times so I was interested in seeing what it was like. 

I liked the layout of the restaurant and I was meeting a group from work so the fact that there was a little noise didn't bother me.  It's definitely not a quite place but I didn't feel as if I was shouting to speak with my other coworkers.  At the beginning our service was very good, very tuned in with what our party was doing so I appreciated that.  I ended up getting the Grilled Garlic Chicken which the waiter claimed was his favorite so I tried it out.  It was very very good!  I wish the portions were much bigger for the price.  Yes yes, I didn't have to pay but still, I would've expected just a little more chicken, less decoration and less rice.  I left feeling full but, I think that was more due to the fact that I had enough water.  Our waiter kind of fell off (don't know what happened to him) but I never received my refill of coke that I requested.  I wouldn't mind trying Proof again but it would probably be for a special occasion.  I'll be sure to update you whenever that happens....

We ended up getting to the restaurant around 9 pm. As soon as we walked in I was in love with the decor and ambiance. It's dark and swanky, and would be good for a nice date night out or just a dinner with friends.

Our waiter was completely top-notch. He helped us pick out both a bottle of wine (an Albarino) that was delicious and exactly what we wanted, and three cheeses (2 cow and 1 goat) after hearing what we liked and didn't like. Since it was late, we decided to skip real entrees and just ordered a butter crunch lettuce salad (light and a great summer dish), soup (I'm not a huge soup fan and even I liked it, especially since it had crabmeat on top), and potato gnocchi. The potato gnocchi were the highlight for me. I seriously considered ordering more...just for myself. We also ordered two desserts, although which two escape me a week later. My portion of the bill came to $52.60 (that is after tax and tip), which I didn't think was bad considering the level of service we got and how delicious the food was.

Before the tasting menu, I ordered the fresh ricotta with field greens and some cherry tomatoes drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.  I would recommend anyone this dish.  Fresh cheese is hard to come by for me so I ate this up with glee.  The charcuterie plate came out with an amazing assortment of spreads.  Terrines, liver mousse, pates, beautiful brown cherry tomatoes, red peppers and of course some cured meats..  It was excellent.  When I was younger I would be content eating braunschweiger and toast all day so this really brought back memories.  I wasn't pairing it with wine but my Allagash Curieux had a nice clean finish with the really rich spreads.  

The next course was a sablefish with a miso soy glaze and some dark greens (not sure which) sauteed with soba noodles.   The fish was cooked beautifully.  I'm not sure if it was the alcohol or the fish or both but it almost brought a tear to my eye.  Seriously.  It tasted like it was poached in drawn butter in terms of moistness.  The flavor was all fish though with very little spice except for the perfectly crusted top.  No other fish preparation will do for me anymore.  The next course was the hangar steak with some foie gras on top and some oxtail (yes you read right) ravioli on the bottom.  I was delighted when I saw the oxtail and thought this would be the best part of the meal.  I was wrong but in a good way because the foie gras and steak was amazing combination by the forkful. 

Dessert was a chocolate souffle-like dish with some cream of some sort and some ground pistachios.  When I smelled the dish I felt like I was walking in an Indian marketplace or an Asian grocery store.  I was wondering what it was exactly because the smell really put my mind somewhere else like curry and certainly not with a sweet dessert.  Apparently it was cardamom and the smell was overpowering all the other components of the dessert.  The souffle like chocolate dish was a little dry and crumbly for my taste.   

This place is beautiful on the inside with rich leathers, dark wood, and an exposed wine collection.  It is a very romantic place if you decide to do that but for me it was more of an eating adventure. Excellent meal.

This time, the bacon lardon was plentiful enough to complement the hanger steak.  The chunks of Roquefort, while still a generous size, no longer overpowered the salad.  The base greens remained unoriginal, yet that is a minor issue.  I was really impressed with the salad this time.  

I also had a chance to try the shrimp burger.  It works well as a novelty item, but I would be hard pressed to order it over the hanger steak salad.  Part of the issue with the shrimp burger is portion size (I actually ate a second lunch that day to minimize my hunger pangs) and the other issue is that the flavor combinations do not seem to perfectly match.  As mentioned by Kevin L., it's great for shrimp lovers, but if you like both meats, the hanger steak salad might be a better option.  

I should be back tomorrow to try another one of their lunch items.

We started with the assorted salume (three different Italian cured meats) and three cheeses.  The meats were provided with crunchy toasted bread slices, while the cheese board came with raisin bread, a selection of honey, some sort of apple spread, and a dried fig.  Each cheese was flavorful and unique.  The meats were also quite good - and I'm very hard to please when it comes to charcuterie considering my brother makes his own proscuitto!

For seconds, we had the spicy meatballs as well as the potato gnocci with ramps and asparagus.  Spicy meatballs were good, but I wouldn't recommend ordering them if you're looking for something different or unusual. Sometimes a meatball is just a meatball, even if it's a very tasty meatball.  Now the gnocci, however, were amazing.  Two years ago, I ate at a tiny restaurant in Venice, Italy which specialized in homemade gnocci.  I didn't think I would ever have gnocci to equal that experience, but I think Proof may have beat it. They melted in your mouth and the sauce was very tasty. My boyfriend doesn't eat many vegetables, definitely not mushrooms, but he was spooning it up.

We split the pork loin with caramelized onion & radicchio risotto entree.  All I have to say is that I could have licked the plate. 

Lastly, we had the chocolate bundt cake.  The hazelnut mousse side comes with these delicious little crunchy chocolate ball things (something like Carvel crunchies, but a million times better).  I was worried the combination of chocolates (cake + ice cream + mousse) would be too rich, but they blended together perfectly.

If you're a charcuterie and/or fromage fan, brace yourself. Proof's menu ain't fooling around - there are choices out the ying yang and you won't be disappointed.

Star starters: spicy little meatballs, sauteed gnocchi (just when you thought potato pasta dumplings couldn't get better- but 'em in a sizzlin' pan) and the flatbreads.
Endearing entrees: the duck and the salmon. Mmmm. I tend to overload on starters rather than go straight for the regular menu lineup, but those two dishes were a delight.

I got there a bit early and true to what their website says, they don't open till 5:30pm on the dot.  The doors are locked until that time and the manager came out and unlocked them exactly at 5:30pm.  Since I was one of the first people in the place that evening, I had my choice of seating.  I was there only for drinks though and they won't let you sit outside unless you're ordering food.  Since I was expecting about 8 people, I snagged the big couch they have in the lounge area right by the front door.  Otherwise it would have been small two top tall tables or seating at the bar.  The server came by immediately and frequently during the 2 1/2 hrs we were there.  The great thing about their wine list is that they have 3 different sizes, ranging from 2 oz pours to a full glass. We were able to try a number of different wines this way and the 2 oz pours were generous.  The server was also able to answer our questions and describe the wines.  When we weren't sure, she tried to recommend glasses based on what we liked and even went so far as to look up a wine that wasn't on their list to see if they had it.  It takes a bit of figuring out at the end what you owe though because while she could charge different amounts to individual credit cards, she couldn't split the check by person.  By 7, the place was packed and there were even some people waiting for a spot, drinking wine in the lobby.  The wines were all good quality and the service was excellent, even when they were busy.  Everyone had a good time and we'll be back.
There weren't any specific happy hr specials but the 2 oz pours ranged from $2.50-$5.  They also have a beer and specialty drink list for those who don't like wine or just want something different.

She tried to seat us at a table in the middle of the room, but I asked if we could have a booth since it was a special night.  She had no idea what I was talking about - which I was annoyed with but whatever, i figured it was and Open Table issue.  She let us take a booth which made me happy.

Our waiter was not too friendly, didn't get any warm fuzzies from him which is too bad b/c we were ready to tip BIG but he wasn't worthy of that.

I excitedly ordered 3 cheeses, the pate plate and one meat/cold cut to start and some champagne to drink.  I love this place already!  The champagne was fantastic - enough so that I kept drinking it all night long!  The pate plate was satisfying - quite large, the amount of meat we got was large also and the cheeses were divine!  So delicious!!!

We ordered of the first plate list, the abalone ceviche - I haven't had abalone in so long!  It was really really good!  The seasonings were similar to what you'd get on a tuna tartare but the abalone was so delicious, chewy, and fresh!  We also ordered the heirloom cucumber (how is it heirloom?), tomato and celery heart salad which was very refreshing, the dressing was spot on!  The last dish we ordered was the gnocchi - ohmigod, it was fantastic!  The corn, the mushrooms, the very rich sauce, the gnocchi itself - little hot smooshy delicious bites!

Whew!  So far so good!

Until dessert...I ordered profiteroles, which are my favorite and they were disappointing.  I mean, who puts ice cream IN the profiterole?  It's supposed to be on the side!  The pastry was dry and crunchy, not soft like it should be on in the inside...sigh...the dessert wine I had was fantastic though and overall the whole meal was so good!

I love the look and feel inside of the place.  It's very modern, yet comfortable.  They had a good amount of outdoor seating (it was raining that day so this area was not open) that I would be up for going back to take advantage of.

Shortly after we sat and got situated our server brought over two complimentary glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary (when I booked the reservation through Open Table I mentioned this in the comments section with a simple request that, if possible, they put us at a good table because it was our anniversary.  I appreciated the attention to this detail).

We started with the ahit tuna tartare.  Wow - it was pretty awesome.  We rarely order tuna tartare but if all places made it as good as this I would regularly ordered it.

For dinner we ordered and shared the bay scallops and Alaskan halibut.  If I had to pick the one I liked better it would be the scallops - which are plated on heirloom tomatoes and bread pudding.  But that's not to say the halibut didn't hold it's own.  It was a decent size piece of very good halibut.  

There were many other things on the menu we would want to try.  Compared to restaurants in the same class as Proof I would say that they have a very good number of choices on the menu.  Something for everyone.

For dessert we ordered two: the chocolate mousse and berry shortcake.  I loved the ice cream that came on the shortcake.  My wife, who fancies herself a connoisseur of chocolate mousse, was very happy with her choice.

Upon arriving at Proof, me and a friend were confused to see people waiting around outside the restaurant's locked doors.  Many were clearly irritated, which was understandable since it was cold, and after working all day, every minute that passes without a drink becomes more painful.  We then noticed that the place was not supposed to open until 5:30pm, so when the doors finally did release, it was right on time.  It also helped that we were two of the first people inside, and were able to seize a small table in a corner by the bar.

The dim lights and minimal decor created a seductive environment, which was only enhanced by the crowds that made people sit a little closer.  We were slightly disappointed when we opened the bar wine menu.  It seemed a bit lacking after looking up at the giant wine rack that required a ladder to reach the top levels.  I liked that each wine had three different pours, which would allow someone to taste a wine without commiting to a full glass.  Although, the price of the smallest pour was about what I would pay for wine during happy hour.

The staff was attentive, but let us catch up for a long time while we sipped our wine.  Eventually, we got hungry and decided to order the seasonal pumpkin gnocchi.  The orange-colored potato dumplings were covered with shitake mushrooms, spinach, garlic and a light cream sauce.  I was worried that the pumpkin flavor would be over-powering, but all of the components came together to create one of the most scrumptious plates I've eaten in a while.

The decor is beautiful, and would fit right in in SF.  So would the wine list, which was amazingly extensive (and fairly expensive, but DID feature 5 Screaming Eagle options, which I passed on because I thought my compatriots would object to a $5500 bottle of wine) [hey, that's just $1100 apiece!].

There were some definite service hiccups---it took them 15 minutes or so to take our drink orders, and another 20 minutes to deliver said drinks.  The waitress apologized, and the restaurant upgraded us from the $70 bottle of wine I selected to it's older brother (which would have been $160).  Later in the evening, when I consulted with the sommalier regarding a second bottle, he delivered exactly what I requested: an even bigger, bolder, wine (since we were well into our night of drinking by that time) at a very decent price.

Let me take a moment for an aside: for some reason, I end up picking the wine damn near EVERY SINGLE time I'm out with a group.  Now, I don't want to sound like I doth protest too much, because it at least means I get to ensure we drink something I like.  But I'm not made of magic, folks.  My doctorate was in law, not in wine (they DO give Ph.Ds in wine, and they're REMARKABLY difficult and expensive to come by).  I don't necessarily possess any knowledge, insight, or culture that any of you lack (at least, nothing that relates to wine).  So, if we're out together, be a mensch, do me a favor, and just order the wine yourself.  Just don't order any frickin Pinot.  Unless it's Sea Smoke.  In which case, you're buying.

Back on topic, I can only speak for wifey and I, but the Kobe beef carpachio was wonderful, and whatever wifey populated the cheese plate with was fantastic (they have a list of about 30 cheeses, and you pick 3, or if you're us, 6).  My pork loin, however, suffered from a malady unfortunately common to the dish: it was rather dry.  This need not happen, if the chef properly sears the loin before cooking.  If -I- know the technique, you may rest assured that it is NOT a difficult concept.

By the way, lest I forget, the Glenmorangie 12-year finished in port barrels was wonderful.  They also had a 12-year finished in brandy barrels.  I'm always impressed when these sorts of selections are available---it's a nice change of pace.

My party of four started with 6 cheese selections and the Charcuterie platter. The cheeses were unbelievable and as for the meat, come on. How can you go wrong with 8 or 10 types of cured meat from around the world plus a house-made Pho pate? 

For our entrees my 3 companions each ordered the Maryland soft shell crabs. As a guy who spent a good portion of his childhood summers in Baltimore, soft shell crab was certainly tempting, but I've done it before, so I went with the house-made squid ink pasta. It was exceptional. Perfectly cooked and tossed with a tasty assortment of vegetables and calamari.

Other noteworthy items included the charcuterie board, the ahi tuna appetizer and the tilefish.  One companion had the duck confit which was flavorful, but slightly overdone.  Otherwise, a great meal.

For a simple and romantic Valentine's moment I took my GF to a bar table for a bottle of Champagne and some chocolate dessert. I knew Proof had a reputation for wine, with emphasis on food (moto: ""Food is the Focus. Wine is the Passion"") which is odd for a 'wine bar', but as I am always skeptical of self-made claims I wanted to see for myself.

As we walked in first impression was that the interior was very pleasant with a slight trendiness, but with no inherit pretentiousness. Immediately we found a little table on the wall in the bar area and was spotted quickly by the waitress, who wasted no time getting menus down on the table. She was dressed in a cocktail dress, was pretty, and European, which (no offense to the wonderful and pretty cocktail servers out there!) can signal poor service. BUT she was wonderful. She opened our Champagne perfectly, and poured it just as well. Like a good restaurant with small tables should, they keep the wine on ice away from the table and make sure to keep their service attentive to the level of wine in your glass, which she did a great job of.

The wine list was great. I wanted a descent bottle of wine, from France, without overreaching my dessert-bottle, late-night price range. I went with a Cremant. BUT shortly after the waitress left with my order she came back. Not with excuses, but with solutions: a wine list, an idea of comparable quality bottles, and the promise to keep the actual price charged equal to the bottle they ran out of. Can you believe that? They sacrificed 25% of the bottle's price in order to please the customer without even blinking an eye.

Besides the love we shared for the wine, the chocolate ""bunt cake"" was spectacular. The texture was soft, with an elegant sponginess, and the two ice creams on the plate were of homemade quality. The plating was simple and elegant, without doing too much.

Oh, and the men's bathroom is sexy. Make sure both man and woman check it out, my GF dug it too. Unfortunately for the ladies your bathroom is boring. 

I will def be returning to Proof to a seat at the bar to explore further before counting it as one of my permanent addictions. But for right now, I recommend to anyone looking for a modern, yet classic, and comfortable place to drink interesting wine with good food, GO TO PROOF!

When it opened it looked like a nice place for a romantic dinner.  Unfortunately, my boyfriend lives in Chicago, so it took us until this month to coordinate a Saturday dinner out.  Be warned--you must book in advance!! I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance and the only available times were 6pm or 11pm.  

The place is trendy without trying too hard.  Not that I don't love the trendy restaurants, but Proof has a too-cool-for-school vibe that is sophisticated and relaxed.  Wine really is their focus, it's everywhere you look.  And the bathroom is super cool (there's the uber-trendiness).  The crowd was older, which makes sense given the prices.  No way could I have eaten here in my early 20s.  It was the most expensive meal I've personally ever paid for, but it was well worth.  Service was courteous and professional--she even checked to make sure we weren't going to the theater.  Nope, we were there for a long, relaxing meal.  

We started the meal with a selection of cheeses and flights of wine.  All of the wine was excellent and the cheese platter was delicious.  It also included fruit bread, a fig, and some applesauce (which I ate all of because my boyfriend doesn't like apples...but then he told me he likes applesauce even though he doesn't like apples!  That makes no sense at all!!)  

My boyfriend had some soup before the main course, which he said was really good.  I got a hummus flat-bread appetizer and a couple sides for my entree.  The appetizer was not what I expected, but it was quite tasty.  My sides were mashed potatoes and mushrooms, both delicious.  I also picked out my favorite wine from my flight and ordered a glass of it for dinner.  For some reason their menu won't open up on the website, so I can't check to see what soup & entree my boyfriend had.  I know he ordered fish and said it was great.

Unfortunately, dessert was not as successful.  I have a major sweet tooth, but am very picky about my desserts--I do not like nuts in dessert and I do not like fruit with chocolate.  This limits our dessert selection at most restaurants because fancy restaurants love to combine these ingredients.  We settled on the trio of sorbets without asking what flavors were in it.  Big mistake.  The flavors were: coconut, pineapple, and pomegranate.  I hate coconut & pineapple.  My boyfriend said they were great--good texture, but the pomegranate sorbet was too icy.

Our server explained several of the dishes trying to help us make a choice, but that just made me want to eat all of them.  The portions were pretty big for lunch.  I ended up with the pulled pork panini, which was delicious.  My coworker got the spicy penne with meatballs and she really liked it.  Since it was lunch, no trying the vino.

The ambiance is very nice and modernish?, but brrr it was freezing when we went!  The fan must have been on along with the ac, which made it feel colder with the air moving around.  We asked the server if he could adjust the setting, and he nicely got his manager to turn down the ac.

We were told since we did not necessarily want to order entrees that we would need to be sat on the patio. Fine. It wasn't too hot or loud (8pm). 

First, the food - really great. Together we had tuna tartar, smoked salmon bruchettas, 3 cheeses and dessert.

Second, the service. Our waiter was kind, funny, honest - and attentive. Until he left. We had appetizers, cheese and dessert. It took us two and half hours! That is relatively outlandish, which is a shame because everything else was phenonmenal. Was this an off night?  Perhaps. 

The manager, who became politely aware of our situation, comped us our dessert. So, despite the grumbling about time and forgetfulness - we did have chocolately gooeyness for free.

First off this is one of the great restaurants in DC. There are not many, however Proof pulls out all the stops. I went with three close friends who are all world class expert caliber foodies. Right away we all enjoyed the intoxicating warmth of this place. It's very relaxing with a lot of eye candy, provincial decorum and a great bar. Our server was bright, personable and very knowledgeable with the menu and wine list. Plus it's great being from SF, cause once he found out he stood at the ready to please us. He made an excellent guide all the way around and sounded like he was making the move to Napa soon. You don't often get a waiter of this caliber but when you do, great service makes the meal taste that much sweeter.

We ordered the entire menu, less two dishes. Out of all of our dishes only one was just ok and the rest of the meal was superb. All the wine parings were spot on.

There were a few people waiting outside the door at 5 pm for the restaurant to open on a Friday night.  I was promptly seated by the friendly host staff after having dried off from the rain.

First course: Wagyu Beef Sashimi
 - basically beef carpaccio with an Asian flair.  My only complaint was that the dish as overdressed; I was unable to enjoy the Wagyu beef as hoped
 - paired with Grenache Gris

Second course: Wild Mushroom Toast w House Pancetta & Goose Egg
 - first impression on appearance: ""whoa, that's a goose egg!""  the poached egg atop the yummy sauteed maitake mushrooms was HUGE.  I understand that's what goose eggs are, but jeez, I was not prepared.  Just thinking of how much cholesterol I would be consuming for that one course was too disturbing, so I just gobbled it up... as if each bite was my first.  This was my favorite dish of the night, but next time, I will share the goose egg experience with at least two others.
 - paired with Burgandy

Third course: Alaskan Cod
 - my least favorite of the evening and by far the saltiest.  I couldn't finish the entree due to the fact my mouth puckered like a fish with each bite.  I know I tend to be overly sensitive with my taste of salt, but I truly believe this dish may have had a touch too much to bear... which was a shame because I hoped to enjoy the ""cassoulet"" of white beans that was to complement the fish.
 - paired with Bordeaux

I actually returned later that evening with a friend visiting from out of town for a cheese plate and more wine (plus some whisky).  This is definitely a great place to take out-of-towners and impress them with the expanding DC food scene.

It was an upscale crowd full of beautiful looking people or people who thought they looked beautiful - you can decide which group I'm in!  Similar clientele to Brasserie Beck, but slightly older.  I do have to say the restaurant itself is quite attractive - dark woods, gold mirrors, wines prominently displayed behind curving glass walls, contemporary fixtures.  It manages to be both elegant and hip at the same time.  Enough about the decor (although that does set the tone), what about the food and wine?

Our party of six ordered a few apps to share, including a cheese board, a couple of their flatbreads and the wagyu sashimi.  I didn't try the cheese, but the rest were quite good.  The flatbreads were especially nice - good flavor combinations and the flatbread itself was soft and fresh.  The beef sashimi was nice, with citrus and Asian flavors as the name might suggest (this dish would be called carpaccio elsewhere).

The entrees also seemed to be well received by our table.  I ordered the panko crusted chicken, which was light and tender as I expected.  My friend's pork and risotto was excellent - especially the risotto, which was exceptionally creamy.  My wife's gnocchi was also ""pretty good.""  Overally, I would say the cuisine is very good, but a notch below the top tier of DC-area fine dining restaurants (Eve, Citronelle, etc.)

The wine list is extensive and pricey as one might expect.  Since everyone wanted something different, we instead chose from their by the glass list.  Usually you sacrifice somewhat when you order wine by the glass, but the quality and selection were quite good.  I tried a couple different glasses of pinot noir, both of which were quite nice.  My wife's barbera was ""smooth and really good.""  My friend's red burgundy was so good that he upped the size to the 8.5 oz size for his second glass.

We had a reservation at 8:30 to celebrate Simona finishing with the bar exam and law education as a whole, and also to celebrate me getting her back in my life again!  The bar was buzzing by this point (on a Wednesday), so much so that we decided against trying to fight through it while we waited for our table.  It did gives us time to look around and admire the aesthetics of the interior - this is a very cool and trendy place, and it knows it too!  It was only a short wait, and we were taken to our table, where we started to look over the menu.

It's at this point that some of the minor negative points that led up to losing that 5th star came into play.  Now our waiter was excellent, and he really had to be, because it takes skill to apologize well.  It was the ""supporting cast"" who really let the side down here.  We had to ask for water after it wasn't offered to us in the first five minutes.  When our main courses were brought out, neither of us had a fork (they ran left us along with the appetizer), so we asked the server for 2 forks, and he didn't show up with them - after a few minutes, our waiter appeared, so we asked him, and again, very apologetically and embarrassed, he ran off to get us our silverware.  It's these little things that can annoy people to the extent of not enjoying their meal - thankfully the food is so good here that it wasn't the case.

The other part of that lost star is the selection on the menu - great, they have every wine known to mankind on offer (with the option of taster glasses too, which is very cool), but only 6 entrees!   It was an oddly limited choice, but to my relief I was still trying to choose between three, and opted for the salmon which, as Aaron mentioned in his review, was cooked to absolute perfection - I am rarely 'wowed' by salmon, I think it's actually quite difficult to wow someone with salmon - Proof knows how to wow with salmon!

I had the cheeses for dessert (of course), which were excellent - maybe let down slightly by their supporting cast - I would have liked a little more non-fruit items to go with the cheese, but at the end of the day, cheese is cheese, and cheese makes me happy!

Overall, it was a wonderful meal and I would highly recommend the restaurant to everyone - they do need to sort out some of the issues with the ""supporting cast"" (I'm happy to tag this as teething issues as they have only been open a few weeks), and I would like to see a little more variety on the menu.

Then the Tait Trolley rolls up, and you realized you're about to 1) spend some bank and 2) have a really good time.

However, the menu felt  a bit limited, and call me crazy but food at that price should make me yearn for more.

2250,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=6JGX7h82tSkswPLd1SEY1A,"Wow.  I had a fantastic night here., probably a 4.5 star night, in fact.  Let's go:

Decor:  Modern, clean, with exposed brick.  Very nicely done space.  I really enjoyed eating in here.

Bar:  Very crowded but there was definitely room to stand while we were waiting for our table.  We had a nice glass of Chardonnay while waiting for our table (which we got seated at about 20 minutes after our reservation time)

Now, on to the food!

Appetizer:  The three of us ordered the Charcuterie Board, on the suggestions of the waiter.  He told us that all the other first courses were small, and meant only for one, except the Board, which was perfect for the three of us.  There was something like 8 different meats, a pate, cornichons, and a plate of toast.  Really delicious - I loved the speck and the prosciutto, especially.

Entrees:  I ordered the sablefish.  When I placed my order, the waiter's face lit up and he told me I just made a fantastic pick.  He was right.  This was possibly one of the best fish entrees I have ever eaten.  Ever.  The meat just melted in my mouth, but there was a crisp outer layer.  So incredibly perfect.  Both the people eating with me were amazed at how delicious it was.  It came on a small bed of potato puree, with a side of greens.

My boyfriend ordered the chicken.  I doubted that it could be that good - I mean it's chicken, right?  But, oh my god, it was incredibly.  It was sliced, and  breaded, and probably fried, with this incredible green chili sauce and a little bed of rice.  Fantastic.  Tasty and moist.  

Our other friend had the hangar steak.  From the piece I ate, it was delicious and perfectly cooked medium rare, just how she asked for it.

The portions were definitely small for the price (between 21-24 for the entrees) but they were so good that it just doesn't matter sometimes.

Cheese course:  We decided to go for the 6 cheese board.  There was also the option of a 3 cheese, but we wanted to try so many of them.  We ordered 2 goat, 2 cow, and 2 sheep.  My favorite was definitely the Pleasant Ridge, which is from Wisconsin.  Turns out it's the favorite American cheese of the owner too!  All the cheeses were great, and the descriptions did them justice.

Dessert:  Sticky toffee pudding cake.  Order it.  My friend recommended this to me, and the waiter agreed again that it was the best option on the menu, along with the goat cheesecake.  We didnt try the cheesecake, but I don't regret my decision.  That toffee pudding cake was heaven.  Absolutely perfect.  Yum.

Wines:  It's possible I would have given it this place 5 but the wine markups were absolutely crazy.  Granted, most restaurants do markups, but this was like over 3 times retail cost in some cases.  However, they did have a huge list with a lot of obscure bottles that are hard to come by.  With that being said, we ordered 2 really nice bottles for under $50 each.  First the Lafonde Pinot, which was great, a lighter bottle but still full of flavor.  And a Turley, which is always a safe bet.  It was definitely more bold than the Lafonde and woud be great with a meat or a nuttier cheese.  

Service:  Awesome.  I was surprised to read that others got bad service here.  Maybe we were just lucky.  Our waiter, Omar, was really attentive, helpful with recommendations, and friendly.  We invited him to have a glass of wine, but I guess you can't drink on the job.  Should have been a lawyer, Omar.  Either way, his recommendations were great and he was right on with everything.  Throughout the night, the owner also made the rounds and stopped at different tables, including ours.  That was a very nice touch.

Cons:  Not too many, and I don't expect the ones I have to be problems for long.  First, it took about 20 minutes to be seated after our reservation, which I didn't mind, but may bother others.  Second, it took a very long time between our appetizer and our entrees.  But honestly, I enjoyed not being rushed, and it really gave me time to be excited for my entree.

Price: with tax and tip our bill came out to just over $300.  that's a lot of money, but we did have 2 bottles of wine, a dessert, a cheese, an appetizer, and entrees.  Expensive, but a lovely meal.

Extras:  There is a 6-course tasting menu.  It is $85 or $120 with wine pairings.  The owner definitely recommended it for next time, and I think we'll have to try it.  The timing of the courses would be my only concern.

Lastly, given the markups, we asked if the restaurant let people bring in their own bottles.  you can, as long as it's not on the list.  there is a $25 corkage fee though, which is more expensive than most places.  But since this is a wine-centric restaurant, I can't say I'm surprised.

Wow, this is long.  But as you can tell, I was extremely pleased and can't wait to go back again!

The food is always delicious and inventive--especially given that this place is technically a wine-bar first (and so, at many such places food always seems to be an afterthought or a generic mishmash of ""winebar-ish"" type dishes like charcuterie, flatbreads etc.), the servers are cool and know their wine, and I gotta give props to my man Sebastian Zutant, who is one of the only wine directors I know who will steer plebes to *cheaper* wines instead of the more common upsell.

As I walked on G St to Proof I noticed a really cute restaurant with some outdoor seating, and I was thinking ""That'd be cool if that was Proof!""  And it was!  They had those standing space heaters so the area felt really nice with the slight chill in the air.  When I walked into the restaurant the hostesses greeted me very sweetly.  One of them took me to my table.  Compared to the colder temperature outside, I was not prepared for the warmer temperature inside.  It was very cozy and the dim lighting added to the overall sophisticated vibe I got from the restaurant.  There were lots of people dressed in business attire, as well as young professionals.  Our server promptly came over, filled my glass with water, and gave me a menu.  He also gave us little magnifying glasses with a flashlight attached since it was dark in the restaurant.  It's a cute idea, but wouldn't it be easier to just give more light in the restaurant in general?  

We ordered two appetizers.  The first was spicy meatballs that had a parmesan ravioli with it.  The meatball was pretty good, and the ravioli was amazing!  Really delish.  The other appetizer was a flatbread with olives, hummus and some other veggies on it.  The flatbread itself was really effing good.  I guess I'm just not that into vegetables though.  In between courses, I used the bathroom.  There are two stalls in the ladies' room.  It's pink-themed, but not overly feminine.  There is a really cute slightly distorted heart mirror and other full-length mirrors.  So crucial.

I debated between the roasted chicken and the gnocchi.  Since I don't like mushrooms, as suggested by our server, I got the gnocchi.  And so glad I did!  Seriously THE BEST gnocchi I've ever had.  It literally melts in my mouth.  As someone, who really doesn't know what food is considered ""restaurant critic worth,"" THIS was just absolutely amazing.  It came with a corn relish and like a buttery cream sauce.  At first, it seemed like a small plate, but it was more than enough because the gnocchi was very filling.  We were quite full so we didn't get any dessert but I bet they're really good.  I'll definitely come back!  It's right off of the Chinatown stop.   Love ya Proof

The ambiance is upscale, and bordering on sheik but enjoyable. It's not a cozy cafe or bustling wine bistro...it is an upscale establishment that has delicious and excellent wine.

A spectacular wine list, both by the glass and and bottle. Pull a seat at the bar and stare at $50k of greatness...some special Italian refrigerator/vacuum/pouring device that keeps bottles and the wine inside in premium condition, despite being opened already. This may be the greatest aspect of this place and is NOT to be underestimated: not only is the machine memorizing to watch if you're sitting at the bar (it can automatically pour your glass in three sizes, one being a small 2oz taste which gives you a great chance to try some excellent wine for a small price), but the wine really does taste as it should once poured. No more open bottles with cork lying around on a disorganized table...

My estimation is there are roughly 25-35 wines by the glass. Californians, Argentinians, French, a few other regions...it doesn't seem an old-world bias like some wine bars (which isn't a problem either). 

The wine bottle list is an indulgence if you're up to the price. Bottles of Screaming Eagle...Lafite and Mouton Rothschild...not for the faint of heart or dollar but it is impressive. A big-time 5-star wine list, with 20 or 30 pages filled with some great auction finds.

Some complain of the lack a deeper ""soul"" like its counterpart Cork a few subway stops away, but I find this a little misguided. Proof is a great place for great wine. Simple as that. You should try.

My best friend and her husband were visiting from NYC this weekend, and invited us into DC for dinner last night.  They picked the place, and although it looked nice on the website, it brought back less than favorable memories from the last ""wine bar"" type place that my husband and I had visited - so I was a little concerned.

My fears, thankfully, were unfounded.  

We got there a bit early, so we had a chance to sit at a table in the bar area and check out the selection of beers, wines and cocktails.  My husband was relieved to see a nice selection of beers.  I had a hard time choosing from a creative list of intriguing cocktails - which is a pleasant hard time to have.  I selected the Calibre, and it was tasty.  I could go back over and over just to try them all!

Our friends arrived and we were seated right away.  The lighting was very dark - but that worked for me.  I think had it been much brighter it might have seem less intimate and more intimidating.  I really liked the decor and the atmosphere.  It was sophisticated, but not overly pretentious.  The server was friendly, and helpful, and volunteered to move our table, noticing that we were a bit too close to the table behind us.  
We chose three cheeses to start, and our server made a last-minute substitution for one of them that 3/4 of the table ended up saying was their favorite of the three - great choice!  I love that!  The cheese was served with bread that had raisins in it - which wasn't a problem for me, but wasn't a good choice for everyone.  They brought out some thin crackers and a creamy buttery herb dip (?) also - delicious!

She gave us plenty of time to enjoy our cheese, crackers and drinks before taking orders.  At another restaurant I would have been displeased with that, but somehow it seemed to be the right pace for this meal.

I ordered the Ahi Tuna tartare and the Meatballs with ravioli.  The tartare was obviously high quality, but only 'ok' overall.  It had a couple of small pieces of avocado, and was served with something I think may have been seaweed ""chips.""  It just wasn't what I was expecting.  It just seemed like a pile of tuna chunks, and I thought there would be more ingredients, more flavor.  I asked for more of the flat crackers, which she brought right away, but it just wasn't enough.  Some toasted bread rounds would have been much better.  I wouldn't order it again.
The meatball dish, however, was OUTSTANDING!  The meatballs were not overly spicy, but did have a breath of heat to them.  They were nicely sized, not dry, and well seasoned.  And the ravioli were amazing.  My friend had a bite and said she could eat a whole meal of just the ravioli!  So, so good.  Creamy, and seasoned with fresh herbs.   Mmmmmmmmmmm...
My husband had the Hanger steak, which he said was very good.  My friend had the duck, which she said was delicious.  She was, however, disappointed that it was served with a sweet potato dish, which she doesn't eat.  Luckily for me, I LOVE sweet potatoes and thought it was creamy and divine.

We ordered desserts - panna cotta, chocolate spice cake, and sticky toffee pudding cake.  They were all delicious.  I also had the Sauternes dessert wine which was soooooo good.

I had a really great time, and a really great meal, despite the tuna.  I would go back in a heart-beat.

I've gone before for drinks and cheese, but this was the first time I ordered off the menu. As I'm sure you already know, they have a great wine selection (though I wish the Gewürztraminer was still on the glass list).
 For dinner, we ordered the Asian greens salad (incredibly fresh), the sablefish and the halibut- both my friend and I agreed that both fish were cooked well. I particularly liked the seasoning on the sablefish; the halibut seemed almost bland in comparison. Definitely need to eat that with the sauce on the plate it comes with. For dessert, she ordered the bread pudding (not bad), and I got the sorbets (we both agreed that the blackberry sorbet is the BEST sorbet we've ever had. Ever). Also, we got a glass of the Freemark Abbey Riesling, and she ordered the Brachetto D'aqui (I think...) I only mention these two specifically because they turned out to be the most memorable orders of the evening- perfect way to end dinner.
Service was great- we sat at one of the high tables in the bar area, and our server (didn't introduce herself, but the dark haired woman with tattoos behind her right ear) helped us with our orders, and was very attentive, even after the place started filling up and got busy, though the service did slow down (to be expected).

The wife and I had an early dinner, 5:30, and the restaurant was about 50% full with customers.  On our V-day dinner, Proof had a special menu, which we opted not to get.  We tend to do the a la carte deal whenever we dine at such places, so we can steal each others food.  

I'll start with their food.  Wifey had the veal sweetbreads and I had the pumpkin, roasted chestnut soup with smoked duck and foie gras.  The veal sweetbreads were AMAZING.  I mean this dish is probably one of our favorites.  Poached and then gently sauteed, sitting on a bed of mashed potatoes, goodness I want another one right now as I'm typing this.  Beautifully done!  The soup wasn't awesome, but still very tasty.  It had thin slices of smoked duck, which fit very well with each spoon full of soup.  The pumpkin and the roasted chestnut played well together.  I recommend both items.  For our entrees, wifey got the duck confit, pork confit, and grilled sausage cassoulet and some young greens.  The pork confit was the winner in my opinion of the three items.  It was very tender and the fork pulled the meat right off.  The duck and sausage were also very good.  I got the honey glazed duck breast which sat on a yam puree and some pomegranate vinaigrette.  At first, I tasted the duck and yam and it was only okay to me.  The pomegranate was there for a reason, so for my next bite, I blotted my fork in it and the three flavors came together very well.  Last up and probably our favorite was the sticky toffee pudding cake.  This dessert will want you asking for more!  It's so good, you don't even want to talk and just enjoy the flavors in your mouth.  The moist, rich, warm, pudding cake is so good and you then swipe some of the goodness toffee on your fork and last up a bit of vanilla ice cream and WOW.  This is a must get if you go here.  Order it first if you're afraid you'll get full later.

Service was great and we couldn't complain.  Water cups refilled, server checked on us as each course was served.  He recommended wines for us.  With the wines, there's a very good selection and their wine encyclopedia is a good size.  They also offer three sizes of wines by the glass, so if you opt to do a 2oz for each course, that's an option.  The bar was pretty crowded too when I glanced over.  If you expect ESPN playing, think again.  There are four panels flipping through art pictures, so this isn't a place to hang out with the Sports Center crew. 

Overall, a great environment and there's nothing we didn't like about this place.  We definitely would visit this place again down the road, especially for that sticky toffee pudding cake!!  We'd probably sit at the bar the next time around just for this dessert and sip a glass of wine.

But I am surprised more folks have not commented on the hilariously dim lighting.  This restaurant is so dimly lit they actually hand out small squeeze-to-light LCD magnifier flashlights with your menu (if you dine after dark at certain tables) so that you can see what the #$&# is written on the menu.  We handed most of them back after we were done ordering but the waitress wisely left one on the table, and damn, we were grateful she did, since when our food arrived we were reduced to handing it around so that we could get a glimpse of what the f---- was on the plate.  I had a lobster-with-buttery-noodles dish, and I'm still wondering, were there mushrooms in it?  Or were those sea urchin pieces?  Or maybe really well seasoned pieces of upholstery?  I couldn't really get a good look.  

I guess it's kind of like that restaurant I read about once where they keep the lights out and all the waiters are blind (so that they can smoothly negotiate the pitch-black dining room)  --- it forces diners to focus on the taste of the food.   

And probably, the other virtue of the dim lighting is it makes for great comic potential among your dining party.  You can start eating someone  else's food and pretend that's just because you don't know that's not actually your plate.  Give that a try and let me know how it goes.

I do however know what good food taste like and this place has it. Started the night with a nice buzz with recommended cocktails then moved into their term for appetizer ""First"". This was also where I started my journey of ""sophisticated-food-words-that-don't-mean-what-you-think"". I ordered the Pan Roasted Veal Sweetbreads as my ""First"" dish. This dish was delicious but I found out that sweetbread isn't really sweet or a bread, its veal glands, such as thymus or pancrease. So the mystery of the mystery meat solved. For the main entree aka ""Second"" I was recommended by the server to order the ""Cassoulet of Crispy Pork, Duck Confit & Boudin Blanc"". Now if you're like me you probably only recognized three words; Crispy, pork, and duck. Since I love pork and duck and things that are crispy, I said bring it on! So while waiting for this dish to arrive I wanted to educate myself further so Google the word Cassoulet. Man... was that a great idea! First thing that popped up was the definition of the word according to urban dictionary. It had us cracking up and of course I had to share it with our server. He thought it was funny but he kinda got defensive and started bad mouthing urbandictionary.com which I kinda didn't appreciate. Needles to say we had a great time and I'll definitely be coming back.

made from fresh, quality ingredients, the food is not revolutionary but prepared well and delicious. the bf & i were not super hungry so split several first courses, a small selection of cheeses and a second course. one of the first courses was a GRILLED EGGPLANT SALAD, which had a lovely smoke flavor, although the eggplant needed some seasoning. i enjoyed the combination of sweetness from the peppers, texture of the pumpkin seeds, and tangy saltiness from the dressing. the YUKON GOLD POTATO GNOCCHI was also tasty, with earthy wild mushrooms, sweet corn and spinach in a thick broth sprinkled with cheese. the gnocchi was very soft, almost too soft, but the flavors were good.

the cheeses we shared tended to the mild spectrum as far as cheeses go, and included MAHON--a cow's milk dry spanish cheese-, GARROTXA--a goat's milk soft spanish cheese, and DANTE--a sheep's milk cheese from wisconsin. i liked the dryness of the mahon and the depth of flavor from the garrotxa, but found the dante pretty straightforward.

on recommendation from our server, we had the VADOUVAN SPICED ALASKAN HALIBUT as the second course. i didn't really taste much of the coconut in the broth, but liked the crunchy texture on the surface of the fish, and the flavors of the spices. the fish was perfectly cooked.

our server was quirky, but prompt and helpful. coming from california, i found that attire is dressier, and dinner was a little more formal than i'm used to for a wine bar, but it seems like a great place for a date.

Finally made it to Proof and given the experience, I would put Proof in my top ten for DC.

For our first course, we had:
Roasted baby beets with carrots, pea shoots, roasted hazelnuts and aged goat cheese
Salad of roasted acorn squash, baby arugula, bacon lardons & guyere

The baby beet salad was delicious, the pea shoots were perfectly dressed and the combination of ingredients worked perfectly (and probably why this is a salad I have met before at other restaurants), but quite honestly might have been the best take on it I have had. The roasted acorn squash was also delicious. Both presentations were beautiful as well.

Second course
Scallops with celery root puree, pea shoots and caramelized onion-wasabi emulision
Duck breast with roasted yam puree, fig-black walnut vinaigrette and grilled scallions

The second course was also delicious bit missed on a couple of fronts. The scallops may have been a touch overcooked -- and there was a bit of a sauce that was like a sweet honey mustard that didn't quite match the dish, at least for me. The duck was very good as well, though slightly overcooked as well, but well seasoned and both dishes we again beautifully presented.

I have to admit, when proof first opened I went online and checked out the wine list. It's probably the reason why it took me so long to eat here. It kind of struck me as new money and pretentious -- horrible thing to say (sorry) -- but just gave me the sense that I would not be a big fan. I pretty much stand by that feeling -- but the good news is that is limited to the wine list and not the overall experience. The list is a bit bent on California with a large number of cult producers with high price tags, primarily Cabernet and Syrah. Their selection of U.S. white wines was a bit more interesting to me with a large handful of Viogniers to choose from. Also a large selection of Bordeaux, again with some rather weighty prices. Most of my favorite wines are from the Rhone valley and south of France and thought that selection was disappointing. The selection by the glass was quite good and pours were decent.

Our waitperson's name was Sarah. She was genuine, enthusiastic, attentive and knowledgeable. She helped us make some great decisions, including wine. She was always there at the appropriate moments, but was not obtrusive and did not hover. Quite possibly the best waitperson I have had in DC.

We finished the night with a cheese course -- that was also quite good. The ambience is also very comfortable and pleasing as others have noted.

The restaurant is ideally situated near the red line and so it was easy to get to.  We decided to order a wine flight and let our waiter choose the wines for us.  They were all good in their own way and it was fun to experiment and try a variety of wines.

The food was very, very good.  We ordered a variety of tapas to share, including the mushroom quiche (awesome), the mediterranean flatbread (tasty), the beet salad (very good) and the cheese platter (yummy).    The one negative was the dessert.  We ordered the passion fruit cheesecake and I wish someone had warned us how tart the fruit was.  

We lingered at the table long after our food was done and I appreciate that no one gave us the check or otherwise tried to rush us.  We stayed for nearly 3.5 hours.

The hostess told us it would be 2 hour wait for a table (I'll think about reservations the next time), but fortunately we were able to find a small, open table near the bar where they served the full menu. 

As has been mentioned in other reviews, a huge plus for the lady friend and I (both emerging wine aficionados), is that Proof offers wine by the glass in 2oz, 6oz, and 8.5oz (I think...) pours. We started with 3 wines each (2 oz pours) to see what we wanted to buy by the glass. The tasting pours are all priced around 3 bucks We're both big zin fans and it appeared the closest comparable varietal by the glass was an Italian Primativo--a bitter disappointment. The cheaper Bordeaux on the menu, however, was AWESOME--very silky smooth. Several glasses were ordered. 

About buying glasses vs. buying a bottle at Proof. Each 6oz glass of the aforementioned Bordeaux was priced at $10. If you figure an average 4 glasses in a bottle, our simple math works out to $40. Looking up the bottle price on the menu, however, sees it listed at $60. Obviously, the usual ""buying a bottle is a bit cheaper than buying 4 glasses"" does not always hold up. 

The food: 

We started off with their full charcuterie platter. At ~$28, it was an enormous amount of mostly prosciutto, Serrano ham, various ""salume"", a bit of sausage, and pate as well. Essentially, you're getting everything listed above it on Proof's charcuterie menu. Everything was delicious with the sausage and pate being standouts. Easily shareable with 4 people.

Almost, but not quite, stuffed to the gills, we ordered two additional items off their first course menu:  Ahi tuna tartare and the sauteed pumpkin gnocchi.

The tuna was exceptionally fresh and was served stacked between two triangles of fried nori.  The pumpkin gnocchi was the standout of this course, however.  Warm, rich, and supple gnocchi sauteed with mushrooms and parmesan.  It is exactly what you want when the weather outside is still a bit colder than you'd like.  A warm blanket in and of itself.  Fortunately for next time, it comes in entree size as well!

We closed out the meal with a glass of dessert wine recommended by the server (a French Rhone) and called it a night.

One thing is for certain.  There is no proof that this is a gourmet meat and cheese deli or is there?  The char""cute""terie is nothing to die for and serving these fine meats without cheese is pure chicanery and tantamount to culinary suicide.  

The divine comedy is being forced to order the meat tray and then having to go three more levels into purgatory before meeting the gourmet cheese level.  Everyone knows that meat and cheese go together like Sonny and Cher and peanut butter and jelly.  Some one needs to let the management in on this well kept secret. 

The wine list has more pages than Obama's stimulus plan and prices that would make a Senator blush with envy.  It is not certain whether the Chateau Lafite or other $6,000.00 bottles of wine are actually in the wine cellar or are on the menu for shear terror value that your date or someone in you party will want to order one.  The wine by the glass is poured from an enomatic, meaning that the bottles are kept in a slim coffin like fridge and exact portions are pumped out into glasses at just the right temp.  No fluffs or over pours are possible or can be expected, don't ask.  

Proof still has its qualities and it isn't value or culinary knockouts.  The booths are tall and comfy enough to nap on if you get the chance.  It presents itself as a romantic little place perfect for impressing that date with your penchant for indulgence.  The bathrooms are well designed and curvaceous women hang in place of the sports pages in the men's room.

Ahi Tuna Tartare - Your standard tuna tartare...nothing exceptional.  I would skip it next time.

Crispy pork confit w/ Savoy Cabbage Slaw - Meaty and fatty, just how confit should be.  I'm not a huge fan of eating meat with visible layers of fat so it was a little off-putting, but it definitely had a nice rich, salty flavor to it. 

Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras - Hard to mess up foie gras.  Yummy but again nothing that I haven't tasted before. 

Sauteed veal sweetbreads - My dining companion was so happy indulging in this dish.  Very tasty, slightly sweet, quite delicious.  Would definitely recommend. 

Chicken Liver Mousse with Red Onion Jam - Really tasty...you get 3 little toasts topped with a generous portion of silky, buttery rich mousse complemented perfectly by the sweetness of the jam.  My mouth is watering thinking about this dish.  

3-Cheese plate - My favorite.  I don't quite remember which cheeses I tasted, but I do remember loving them all.  Nothing pleases me more than to savor a glass of wine with a plate of delicious cheese, and this definitely fit the bill.  I would go back just for the enjoyment of this platter.

2435,Sonoma Restaurant & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=TmXtZcXp0yY7dsA8t9HRgg,"Whenever I go to Capitol Hill, I always feel like I'm a tourist in my own city. Sure it's just a couple of miles from my humble abode, but something about it just seems so different.

Maybe it's all the interns, or all the pompous staffers, or the intense police presence. I don't know exactly what it is, but I'll take it. It allows me to step out of my normal hustle and pretend I'm somewhere far, far away.. all in the shadow of the capitol.

I went to Sonoma for the first time some years ago, as a young, young lad. I knew nothing of this whole ""foodie"" scene, or why the heck they were serving wine out of a funny contraption in the wall. But now I get it.

Me and the boo had a little date night here last weekend, and I was pleasantly surprised at how lovely everything was. We were able to snag a perfect table on the patio, on the beautiful, atypically cool DC summer evening. 

The interior is very clean feeling, fitting a mold for what most chic-foodie restaurants are trying for. A dark atmosphere, bold lighting fixtures, concrete bars, metal seating. Sure it's replicated all over the place, but who am I to judge? I mean, if I had a house and an actual budget to furnish said house, it would probably not look unlike this.

This is obviously a wine bar, they do nothing to disguise this fact. But happily, they also have a nice selection of beer as well as the hard stuff.

Before we sat down at our table last Friday, we grabbed a beer at the bar just to ease into the evening. We aren't exactly wine connoisseurs, but we try, but either way, starting off with a beer just seemed right in our world.

Once we sat down, we opted for a bottle of pinot grigio. As I mentioned, we don't know what the heck we're ordering, so we just went for a bottle that wasn't the cheapest, but was far from the most expensive, and hoped for the best. And it worked! Yay good wine.

To go along with our nice chilled bottle, we picked out a couple of cheeses. I like cheese. I don't really discriminate with many cheeses, but for whatever reason, I found selecting 2 cheeses out of the list of 12 to be harder than choosing the proper wine. So I handed that task over to my man and figured I'd devour whatever arrived either way.

We got a nice blue and a sheep's milk, which were both perfectly paired with slices of crustini and a proper accompaniment. Proper cheese parings are so darn lovely sometimes.

After the cheese, we dove into the main courses. I had the Carolina trout, as that healthily fatty fish is one of my favorites out there. The thing about trout is that sometimes it has the aroma of the stinky water it lived in, which is obviously, expected since it was plucked out of that. But Sonoma's trout was impeccable. They served two huge fillets atop one another, also atop some farrow grain. Perfection on a plate.

My gentleman friend had the pork special, which was a pork tenderloin which similarly looked divine.

As stuffed as we were at this point, and as much as we had intended to go grab dinner somewhere else down the street, after seeing the dessert menu, there was no turning back. Goat. Cheese. Cake.

I can get down with a good cheesecake from time to time, but Gabe, well, that's all he needs in life. So we shared a nice piece of that. And since we had emptied our bottle before the dessert came, we knew we had to do something about such a travesty. He went for a scotch, since peatiness is up his alley, but as much as I wanted to give it a try, I went for a nice neat bourbon to wrap up the meal. And it did just that perfectly.

I highly recommend swinging by for a visit and give it a shot, play tourist in your own town!

Came with a friend for restaurant week dinner.
I had the charcuterie board to start--VERY generous pile of average prosciutto.  I would've preferred a thinner slice, but no big deal.  Thick slice of pate, and a much smaller dollop of chicken liver mouse.  Accompanied by pickled onion slivers, truly fantastic pickled carrot juliennes that had a wonderful kick, and dijon mustard.  The last delicious component was two thick slices of perfectly textured and toasted bread.  This was way too much for me to eat alone--easily shareable by two or three people as an app.  And well worth the $12 a la carte price tag.  My friend had the arugula salad which was nicely balanced and lightly dressed.

For my entree, I had the parpadelle with mushrooms and fried sage leaves.  Loved the greens and the wonderful array of flavorful mushrooms this came with as well the pieces of crispy fried sage.  The pasta wasn't as soft starchy chewy as I wanted and once it cooled got stiff and stuck together really easily.  I kind of just want the mushrooms as their own side dish as the pasta was pretty forgettable.  My friend's trout with spinach, beans, garlic, and lemon was a generous portion, skin on, and was cooked very well, retaining tenderness and moistness.  The balance of flavors was lovely and sophisticated.

Dessert was nothing too exciting.  We had the chocolate bread pudding with fresh whipped cream and the brown butter cake--a bit hard and dry, though the bourbon apples were nice.

Service was excellent, and since I wasn't in the mood for alcohol, I had their fresh squeezed oj + soda at the suggestion of the server. Really refreshing.

I remember the food being very good and what I like to call gourmet Southern Comfort food. They have an extensive wine list so I tried a few different options while I was there. 

I decided to make reservations and this time bring a few girlfriends with me. Two of us got there early and sat at the bar for drinks before our reservation. Again, since their wine list was fairly lengthy I asked the bartender for what she'd recommend after giving her a few clues as to what I liked. 

She quickly spat out a name that I couldn't identify so I had to ask her to repeat it. She didn't seem like she really wanted to help me eventhough the bar wasn't busy at all. Before I could make my selection she'd walked away. I was thinking ok wow. Later on the rest of my party arrived and they ordered cocktails. My friend who had arrived first asked for her check and a moment later so did I. I noticed the bartender put a check in front of my friend but hadn't brought mine. When I asked about my check she simply pointed to the one in front of my friend and walked away. Like I always say if you're not a people person you may want to choose another job, but I wasn't going to let her lackluster attitude spoil my evening. 

Fast forward to dinner, I ordered the meatballs in polenta (had them before and they are A-mazing), Roasted Rainbow Trout with potatoes and carrots (fish was seasoned perfectly, the potatoes were light and fluffy, the carrots was soaked in molasses so they were brown and were a little off-putting to look at), and a Brioche Muffin (it had a applesauce-like substance in the middle, it was okay but I don't really like crunchy muffins). 

Our waitress was incredibly friendly as well as the rest of the staff, with the exception of our rude bartender. Another highlight was this guy who worked there. He seemed to walk over during the best parts of our conversation and he'd interject his opinion. He definitely made our evening more interesting.

* Food was beyond 5 stars
* Wine list was maybe 3 stars 
* Service was below 3

So why 4 stars?  Because the food was THAT GOOD.  And the prices were incredibly reasonable.

The wine list, in my opinion, was limited for coining yourself as a wine bar and included mostly expensive bottles.  The best value I found on the list was a $50 sangiovese and it was okay but not fantastic.  

Ambiance is kind of strange.  There's nothing on the walls or the shelves...everything is empty...so it doesn't feel as warm or cozy as it probably could.  Plus it was a bit bright in there.  

I ordered a chickpea soup (a special) as an appetizer which was a huge portion, incredibly filling, and really tasty yet understated.  The cheese selection we got for the table was great, especially the compotes that accompanied it.  As an entree, I ordered the braised beef ravioli that came with a mushroom and potato ""jam"".  DELICIOUS.  This was all more than enough food for one person but I managed to have a bit of both the cheesecake (good) and olive oil cake (unreal!) for dessert.  

While I had no issues with my order, there were others in my party that definitely did.  A couple decided to split a salad and they ended up splitting the wrong one so the person with the other salad only got half a portion.  Then that same person got the complete wrong entree (beef ravioli instead of seafood risotto) and it took the entire time we ate to get the right dish out to him.  That's pretty darn crummy.  He got to keep the beef ravioli but since it wasn't what he ordered, eating that plus the risotto was definitely not ideal.  We got comp'ed the risotto as well to make up for it but it still probably really tainted his dining experience.  

At the end of the meal, we were shocked by the affordable price of the check...We all ordered appetizers and a main course plus two desserts to share.  That plus two bottles of wine and several after-dinner drinks ended up being just $45 a person.  What a steal!

For my entree, I had the roasted mennonite chicken.  My date had the rainbow trout.  The chicken was okay.  It was a little too overcooked for me.  It was just meh.  My date's trout was much better.

The wines by the glass list is amazing - better than the bottle only list (all glass wines can be purchased by the bottle). This is great if you want to try a couple of wines. I started with the Peter Franus Bramblin Vineyard zin - I'm a huge Peter Franus fan. The first glass served was oxidized but Hillary (waitperson extraordinaire!) quickly replaced it. My husband started with the Soter Pinot. We had visited Tony Soter's winery in Oregon about 3 years ago and weren't very excited however this glass has made us re-think our opinion. Very nice - a big pinot with lots of fruit (not a ""female"" pinot!).

I started with the cheese plate appetizer which was absolutely delicious. Each of the 3 cheeses was paired with an accompaniment (such as jam) which matched each one perfectly. My husband had the market salad which was a large bowl of fresh greens and radishes (he's quite the radish fan),

He then had the burger and I had the pork which was on top of a bed of polenta topped with wilted greend. He said the burger was good. My pork was dry but the polenta and greens were very good.

Two girlfriends and I met here on a Thursday around 6:30pm to do some Derby Day / Cinco de Mayo party planning. None of us had been here but were hoping for something where we could get comfortable and chat comfortably - none of that shouting across the table / bar at one another.

When I entered, I found a seat at the downstairs bar, which required a little coordinating with some fellow patrons and some reorganization of chairs ... only to find out moments later that happy hour is only available upstairs. This is a pet peeve of mine. I'm sure there's a good reason for this (perhaps to avoid overcrowding and too much noise that would surely affect the diners) and if I were in the other position I'd applaud these efforts, but so far, every instance of a confined happy hour location has worked against me. 

However, Sonoma service and wine more than made up for it.  The lounge area upstairs where happy hour IS served is cozy and comfortable - but with two private parties going on and it being well into happy hour time, we missed the boat and had nowhere to sit. We noticed a couple of benches on the third level, where the bathrooms are, and asked whether we could take our food and drinks upstairs. The server (manager?) smiled but hesitated; I'm not sure what the benches are for but it didn't appear that they were usually available for use. He told us that there is not service up there but said he'd allow us to head up on our own; even so, they delivered our food for us and graciously asked whether we needed anything else. It was kind of fun - we could look down over the rest of the group but hear ourselves think.

I'm anxious to return, this time with hubs in tow.

They had a happy hour white and red (each $6), draft beer ($3) and mixed drinks ($5).  I believe there are food specials as well - one in our party ordered a good-looking margarita pizza.

2500,Sonoma Restaurant & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=CdY3Z0BcUAyXZGCHVUKY-w,"I love a good deal and am a frequent buyer of Groupons/Living Socials/What's the Deals, etc.  I especially love it when they're offered by a restaurant that's been on my radar to try.  Such was the case with Sonoma Restaurant & Wine Bar and the Bloomspot coupon they offered for a three-course tasting meal for two.  I had read multiple positive reviews from trusted Yelpers so it was a no-brainer to take the GF out to dinner.  As its name implies, Sonoma is a wine bar, but from our experience there's a very good reason why ""restaurant"" comes first in its name.  Of course, we also had to have some vino so we selected a bottle of the 2008 Ridge ""East Bench"" Zinfandel off of Sonoma's very reasonably-priced wine list to accompany our food.  The impressive Zin wine improved with each sip (and each course) as it aired in the glass.  It was a great choice as it was full-bodied red which wasn't too heavy or too light, but worked exceedingly well with all of the dishes in our Italian/Mediterranean themed meal.  

For our appetizer course, we shared small plates of Snails in Picchi Pacchi Sauce and Burrata Cheese, Chickpeas, and Eggplant, which was one of only two dishes that came off of the regular dinner menu.  The tender snails were truly one of the highlights of the entire meal as they were bathed in the delicious, spicy, garlicky red picchi pacchi sauce.  The burrata, chickpea, and eggplant was also delicious with the chickpea and eggplant offering a taste and texture contrast to the mild-tasting soft white cheese.  We each received the same dish for the pasta course, Pappardelle topped with Conch Stew.  The pappardelle was nicely al dente.  However, the conch stew, while flavorful, was a bit heavy on the salt for my taste.  Still, the dish was far from inedible and it did offer a satisfying alternative to a traditional red sauce.  For our main course, we each got different dishes, the Roasted Mennonite Chicken with Porcini Focaccia Stuffing, onions, fennel and sausage, which was also off of the dinner menu, and the Pork Shoulder and House-made Italian Sausage with gravy over a bed of kale and polenta.  The roasted chicken was moist and flavorful and was complemented perfectly by the porcini stuffing, fennel and sausage.  The pork shoulder was also tender and flavorful, but the medium-spiced sausage was the true taste revelation of the pork combo.  For our dessert course (which by my count was our fourth course of the three-course tasting menu), we received different items, a Panna Cotta topped with peach jam and Olive Oil Chocolate-dipped Cake with milk jam, peanut mousse and peanut brittle.  The large serving of panna cotta was surprisingly light and sweetened with restraint gaining much of its sweetness from the peach jam.  It was one of the better panna cottas I've ever had.  I'm not a big cake fan.  Still, the olive oil chocolate-dipped cake was moist and possessed a subtle, not overpowering, olive oil presence.  The highlights of this dessert were the peanut mousse and peanut brittle.  Both were lightly sweetened with a hint of salt and delicious.  Thankfully, no peanut allergies here!   

Sonoma Restaurant & Wine Bar isn't minibar, Rogue 24, or Citronelle; however, it served up a completely enjoyable, satisfying meal.  Without discounts, the meal was reasonably priced.  The Bloomspot coupon made it a steal!  However, the best deals in the house are the bottles of quality wines most for under $100.  Sonoma is an all-around treat!

The wine selection is great and our server was very knowledgeable about the different wines. We gave her a description of what we were in the mood for and she brought us exactly that.

With the plethora of three-dollar-sign restaurants in DC, it's easy to overlook good places for the very few times I can get out and afford such dining. Sonoma would not have been on my radar. Our dinner last night proved that it is one worth putting on the list of glad-I-tried-it. Would I return? With a bigger wallet (or some Hill staffers willing to pay), I most certainly would.

My partner felt the decor was a bit too austere, but I'm a bit of a sucker for the standard DC high ceiling/exposed brick/simple colors and tones. I wasn't a sucker for the seat on the toilet, which strangely looks like it's 30 years old and has had many an ass upon it. Seriously, toilet seats are like $20 at Target, Sonoma. Invest in one. One thing we both definitely agreed on, however, was that the decibel level of this place for dinner on a Thursday night was a tad high as boisterious business-suit clad men and women with too much energy and cash to burn drank at the bar. There was a pair of women cackling behind us that certainly wiped away any intimate romantic dinner settings.

I ordered the burger medium rare, which was absolutely delicious. Seriously, you don't need anything extra on this burger because the meat is just that damn good. I ordered a side of kale, which was a very healthy portion and probably the tastiest way I've ever had kale prepared. I would have loved to taste the charcuterie, but I just wasn't willing to pony up $26 for a plate of three. Sad. Sonoma makes efforts to source their food locally and their meats from humane sources, which jives well with me.

the charcuterie board is fantastic. a half-board is plenty for 3-4 people. their soppresata is great, and we were told all the charcuterie was made in-house. it was a great start. the charred octopus was really good, the octopus pieces looked like baby octopus (bigger than fairy squids) and it was really tasty and did not have any rubbery texture or even any fishy flavor. the arugula salad was tasty and seasonal with pumpkin seeds and asian pears. the server even split the salad for us without being asked explicitly to, nice touch. the butternut squash ravioli were excellent. several big raviolis that were stuffed expertly with a delicious squash mixture. the kale and cippolini onions were a nice side for the pasta.

My friend took me here on a recent trip to visit her in DC, and even though we strolled in sans-reservation on a Saturday evening during prime dinner time, we were luckily seated (someone with a reservation didn't show).  The place was jam-packed, so for future reference, I would definitely recommend making a reservation.

The ambience is really nice-- dimly lit but lit enough, romantic without a creepy vibe, and classy without the pretentiousness.  My friend originally steered me towards the upstairs lounge area, where food is also served, but there was another function happening.

We started with a 3-cheese platter, with 9 or so options to choose from.  I don't recall exactly which ones we chose, but the cheeses were delicious; my one qualm would be that there wasn't enough toast.  We also ordered a baby spinach salad with toasted almonds, beets, and apple chunks, which was equally as delicious-- they even split the salad into two servings without us asking!

We then shared a pizza-- sweet potato, glazed onions, and prosciutto.  Since my friend is a vegetarian, she asked to hold off on the prosciutto, but our server brought us the pizza with the meat on, to our horror.  Luckily, my friend is okay with eating food that's touched meat, so we kept the pizza he brought to us, and I had twice the amount of prosciutto on my half of the pizza.  Score!

The waiter was otherwise pretty attentive to our water glasses, and even though when we sat down we were told specifically that we might have to give up our table at a certain time, not once did we feel rushed, and we even stayed past whatever that time was that the hostess told us we might have to leave our table.

After dinner, we migrated upstairs to the bar (where we originally wanted to dine), and Juan the bartender took care of us all night.  He's absolutely amazing.  We polished off the night with the pistachio sundae-- which was absolutely DIVINE.  We ended up staying until the restaurant closed.

Food was 5 stars; half a star off because of the vegetarian pizza situation.  Overall, a very nice dining experience!

I was pleasantly surprised with Sonoma after my first visit (finally) last evening.   The fact that I had a Groupon to use here was icing on the cake - I only wish I had bought more of them!

Feeling like red wine, I opted for the quattro mani '08 montepulciano on the ""lighter, fruit-forward red"" wine list (pretty awesome taste and quantity for a $7 glass) and followed up with a second, slightly less memorable glass (i think provido or something was in the name?).

Got a bunch of cheeses (the cocoa cardona was the standout - delish w/ the date chutney accompaniment!), the bf got some proscuitto (not as rare as he likes it, he said...i'm not a meat eater so i can't comment), and shared some of the kale w/ pine nuts and golden raisins - pretty good but i guess i'm partial to sauteed kale (like the yummy one at Cork).  The grilled focaccia was unreal - so simple, yet so good.

Our waitress was also great - I think her name was Emily or Ashley? Very polite and welcoming, which is not something to take for granted in a ""wine bar"" environment (though Sonoma seemed to be more of a restaurant than wine bar).

Mmmm, Sonoma. 

Though your kitchen was horribly in the weeds this weekend, your beautifully executed dishes were a feast for the senses. Your rabbit rillette was earthy, tangy, and smooth, paired with a wonderfully smoky grilled flatbread, your delicate mussels flavorful with olives and sweet fennel, your pocono trout delicately cooked and dressed with a light, citrusy caper sauce, and your fingerling potatoes tender and delicately seasoned with salt and pepper. 

Your hangar steak was wonderfully firm, nicely textured, and perfectly black and blue, though your tomato sauce was a touch bland and did not enhance your deep flavors, and your pheasant country pate, while filled with knobs of meat and served with grainy mustard, needed a bit more spice. But not to worry, darling, your wine flights and tastes were lovely, and your wine menu sensibly organized.

This is just a plug for the simple pasta dish that's offered as an appetizer. It's delicious, and surely enough for a full meal. The modest price allows one to spring for another glass of wine. The hamburger may be the best in DC, no foolin. Bartenders are knowledgeable, and servers are good with coming up with suggestions for trying wine, and pairings. 

Sonoma is delightful and reliable year-round, whether outside, downstairs, upstairs, at the bar, or in the private dining room. The variety of seating areas is key, because naturally, the restaurant sees its fill of interns, and older Hill types and Members  who still act like desperate interns. Their yearnful posing with each other at the bar is mostly laughable, though, not so offensive as loud. The hostess can seat you somewhere away from that scene, if you ask.

2615,Sonoma Restaurant & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=7-jzRFWYDTk9saQjU9DqTg,"My husband and I really LOVE Sonoma. 

Our first experience was a gift from my husband's co-workers and it was dinner for two at the location in Virginia Beach.  FABU!  We had just gotten married and our menu had ""Congrats Cindy & Mac"" across the top.  They will custom menus for you, which we thought was an awesome touch.

We signed up for Restaurant Week in DC 2010 and our first pick, Sonoma in Capitol Hill.  We went on a week night.

First we were pleasantly surprised that the menu had multiple items to choose from and not just one prefix menu.  Everything we had was full of flavor, nothing we didn't like.  

My husband had sardines for his first course - super tasty (which shocked me because all I can think of are the sardine cans my mom used to buy! UGH)  I had the cheese platter, when it arrived it only had three or four small pieces of cheese and a few slices of bread with three different sauces.  OMG, so yummy!  And plenty for us to split.

Second course, husband had dry aged steak and I had pasta...wow, but fantastic, my pasta was such a huge portion I couldn't eat it all.  

Third course husband had Brown Butter Cake and I had Goat Cheesecake.  OMG, both fabu!  Rich, but not too much that we couldn't finish and we split each one, so we both got to try each other's selection.

Our waitress, AWESOME!  She totally called it on the wine, recommended two great choices (We had both) and it was perfect.  

The ONLY thing that would deter us from going back...table were so close together that the VERY LOUD group of three girls next to us were so LOUD, we really couldn't enjoy our evening together.  

Look, I understand that you want to get together for someone's birthday and have drinks, etc.  BUT, you are adults, have a little respect for the people around you and please don't yell (and I do mean yell) the entire sorrid story about how your husband apparently went home with an intern one night and you waited up for him, and then bring up that you haven't been exactly an angel either because you travel and get drunk, etc.  But blah blah, then your friend starts talking about how she only knows how to pick Fing A holes, etc.  LOL  

Seriously, we couldn't hear each other speaking for the noise at the table next to us and we did not have the same experience at the other Sonoma location.  They are laid out differently, and the one in DC is narrow and a little tighter fit.

Our food and waitstaff experience WONDERFUL!   Just wish they could improve the layout so that we don't have to hear every detail of three drunk girl's lives as we eat.  Jerry Springer should come here for new ideas!

Sonoma strives to evoke the best of the California wine country, with quality wine offerings (many by the glass).  It also has great food.  For starters, the cheeses are good, and the charcuterie is awesome (even though I did get a touch a food poisoning once from it, but I'd risk it again).  Local ingredients and attention to detail make this pricey place worthy of a little pretentiousness.

Martinis are generous, delicious and expensive.

We split a few appetizers to start - the charred octopus, the stuffed squash blossoms, two cheeses, and the watermelon salad. The watermelon was delicious and refreshing with goat cheese and radish. I'm not an octopus fan, but it got rave reviews from my mom. The stuffed squash blossoms were a little overstuffed - more of a fried cheese delivery vehicle. The cheeses were delicious, but we wished they came with a more than 4 little toasties on which to eat them. My mom, boyfriend I each enjoyed a couple glasses of wine - I'm not too picky or knowledgable about wine, but I enjoyed mine very much. For my entree I got the gnocchi, which was a bit on the heavy side - it didn't stop me from finishing, though I found myself wishing for pizza instead. For vegetarians the mushroom burger gets two thumbs up from my boyfriend - nice and savory, and not just a slab of portobello like many restaurants are wont to do.

For starters, Sonoma has a great cheese plate...They sometimes have burrata on the menu and when they do, you should definitely order it.  For mains, I'd recommend their roasted chicken (always perfectly cooked), their burger (get it with an egg on top), and their chef does a great job with their pastas; the pork bolognese is particularly good.

For my entree, I had the lamb ragu parpadelle.  I was not overy thrilled with the ground lamb and wish-it-was-a-little-more-al-dente pasta.  I understand fresh pasta cannot really be al dente, but I think I was just jealous of my friends' linguine carbonara and pizza with fresh mozzarella, baby spinach and new potatoes.

We were all stuffed and satisfied before even glancing at the dessert menu.  And before we rolled out of the restaurant, I took a peak upstairs at the lounge and could definitely picture myself back there in the near future.  I'll probably take friends visiting from the Bay Area who may be homesick for a little Cali flare.

Of course, they offered a great wine list with several options if you just want a ""taste"" rather than a full glass. The food was awesome: I had a wonderful chilled tomato soup that had a bit of a kick with a NY strip steak. I've had better steaks, but this isn't a steakhouse and I may have been better off ordering something else. I just couldn't resist actually being able to eat beef, as this was grass fed, local, and humanely slaughtered. Tough to find in DC. Desserts were very good but not great. 

Our server was lovely and answered all of our questions and was able to recommend wine as well. He was attentive but not hover-y and everyone who worked there seemed to be enjoying themselves, which is something suprising during RW. 

The atmosphere of the place was perfection: exposed brick, high ceilings, and warm light. I hate it when places are super-dark in the name of ""mood lighting."" They had some really big tables that would be great for large parties or were split up for several groups, Euro-style. Miriam and I checked out the bar/lounge rooms upstairs and they were also beautiful. Can't wait till the Elite event!

I'll definitely be back at Sonoma. I think it's a great place to bring your parents, celebrate a birthday, or have a nice dinner date. Plus, with Miriam discovering how the DC cab-zoning can work in your favor from Dupont, it's a cheap place to get to!

I really love the decor with the brick walls.  In addition to standard seating, the first floor has three large tables that could easily sit 8-10 people.  The second floor is gorgeous as well, and is ideal for private parties or events.

The wine list is very impressive.  Those who love wine should visit immediately.  Although I am dense when it comes to wine, I was very happy with everything I tasted (though my date was very into wine.)  Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about the wine and the food.

So let me move on to the food.  While the appetizers and main entrees are good, they are not out of this world.  They allow and encourage you to ""double"" an appetizer so it becomes an entree, which I really appreciated.  My favorite things to order are the charcuterie and cheese boards.

Start with the cheese course - highly recommended, as they offer some wonderful selections (personally a fan of the humboldt fog, durrus and idiazabal). What's great about their cheese course is that you can opt for as little as 2 or splurge on the whole shebang (is that how you spell it?). Oh, and get the accents (herbed nuts, truffled peaches, pickled green onions and wine marinated figs) to go with.

About 6 of the 10 wines I liked, though a few of them tasted really cheap. On the flip side, they were good portions. After we finished this off, we ordered the ""Make America Gay Again"" flight which was kind of eh. The blue wine was just a novelty, not that great. The red one wasn't bad.

We were a bit hungry, so we ordered the three different bruschettas they had available. They came out quickly! Be warned, they are about two or three bites each. Really small! But really delicious! One of our friends ordered a grilled cheese, which tasted ok. It wasn't as good as I expected based off of some of the reviews here.

The prices for everything was average, with the exception of the scotch and the food. The scotch was much cheaper than I anticipated. The food was kind of pricey. Overall, great vibe, great staff, and great munchies/wine.

Yesterday @Tia L. and I dined their brunch, both enjoying the Shrimp/Grits and Pomosa's. The restaurant layout is similar to the historic row houses around DC with a tall, slim layout. The back patio is very cute and unexpectedly intimate. It was a perfect fall day in regards to the weather so we dined out there.

The entree was season perfectly, with no salt/pepper required. We also had a scoop of greek yogurt, fresh kiwi slice and granola, as well as, potatoes (thinly sliced). I would be crazy not to go back and try out their lunch/dinner menu. I suggest this place for quiet eats and cute dates. Parking in the area is a little hard to find but its expected for the area.

2776,The Pursuit Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=yXQnRMJJXvo9UEcK8U856w,"I came to The Pursuit for a friend's birthday brunch, and the first thing to note was that they quickly accommodated our large party of ~15 without complaint, even though the birthdayer (because that's a word now) had not made a reservation. This was already giving The Pursuit good marks.

I have to echo others' sentiments that the decor is a bit unusual. It is not unusual for its own sake, but rather because this place brands itself as a wine bar but definitely doesn't feel like one. It does, however, give off a brunchy feel, especially in the upstairs area with large windows.

As with all brunches in D.C., one wonders about the drink setup. You can choose one of two main options: Bottomless mimosas for $10 or a pitcher (that serves 4-5 people) for $12. Several of us shared a pitcher of Blushing Mimosas (OK, Maschio Prosecco, pineapple juice and grenadine), which was not only delicious, but also super affordable. Their brunch menu includes such items as omelettes, loaded French toast, and a variety of bagels and croissants. 

I had a bagel with egg and cheddar cheese, which came with a nicely presented side of home fries and a mini-parfait with fresh blueberries. The bagel was pretty standard, although I have to give them points for toasting it just right and adding a slight-but-totally-just-enough layer of butter that softened the inside. The egg was sort of like an egg patty and a tad bit reminiscent (in appearance, not taste, fortunately) of Mickey D's. The home fries were seasoned well, and the parfait was a nice little topper to the meal.

The mimosas were great, and they have several different flavors, which is a nice departure from your typical brunch restaurant. Our server was kind and attentive, despite the fact that we know our party's size (we occupied almost the entire upstairs area) was keeping her busy. A random side note: They had great old (think 80s & 90s) music playing in the background.

I'm sure I'll be back here at some point, and when I do return, I'll be sure to experience the wine bar side of the restaurant (and update this review)!

2800,The Pursuit Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=KaMxWbwS-W5TZoh_7xwaTQ,"How can you not love a wine bar that makes custom grilled cheese sandwiches? 

So here's how it works:

The staff offers you a slip of paper with their drinks menu that's like a sushi ordering menu and you order one from each category: bread, cheese, spread, and add-ons (http://static.squarespace.com/static/52f91219e4b02b9edeec8b28/t/539f11fde4b0b8ba065f66ed/1402933757404/Food%20Menu.pdf). 

You're not restricted to just one in each category, but there is an additional charge for add-ons. Basically there are seven different breads and cheese, and you can order bacon, tomato, argula, pesto, hummus, sun-dried tomatoes, etc, etc, on your sandwich. One review mentioned that the grilled cheese at Cheesetique is better, I'm actually thinking the ones here a infinitely better. I guess it was something about the having a choice of filling and these grilled cheeses are way less greasier.

About the wine and drinks. Well you're not be hurting for options here. The beverage menu has about 40+ wines (all reasonably priced), several cocktails and a handful of beers on tap. I went with a white wine flight ($10) and was surprised by the Orvieto offered. Never tried it before but loved it.

They also offer Anjou Mules in copper mugs. The same copper mugs that people like to klepto in bars across America, so I suggest you enjoy your moscow mule now before the mugs are all gone.

As for the service, we were well attended to, and the food arrived quickly. It made for a great relaxing evening. I wish we could have checked out the bar upstairs, which is more loungey  but they were closed for a private event. 

Sadly I realized after I left they offered my favorite cocktail of all time here, the Aviation (Gin, lemon juice, maraschino liqueur, crème de violette), this just gives me all the more reason to return. I just have a feeling this place will probably become the date spot to be at on H Street!!

-less than enthused bartender. Literally didn't see her smile once. She acted like us being there was an inconvenience.  Someone else mentioned they were short staffed so I bet she was just overwhelmed but you gotta give a smile or something.  Fake it till you make it. 
-Gazpacho was weird and chunky.  It literally was like salsa out of a jar. Bizarre.

It's what they focus on (besides wine), so it makes sense that their grilled cheese is great.  And so is the wine.  Two of my favorite items, paired together.

The Pursuit is small, but a lounge-y upstairs and a back patio offer space in addition to the compact bar.  The exposed brick, duct work, and metal accents could give it an industrial feel, but modern, dim lighting, mirrors, and additional wood accents counteract that, making it an inviting, intimate restaurant--definitely great for date night (though perhaps more soundproofing is needed).  Service was outstanding--extremely friendly and knowledgeable, plus quite attentive.

I went with the rosé flight, and was not disappointed.  A sparkling version was included and that was my favorite.  Beer and cocktails are also offered.  My sandwich was French white bread with tomato, mozzarella, cheddar, and pesto.

Tonight was opening night and it seems that word has already gotten out about this hot new wine bar. With a long bar downstairs and a few tables and couches/plush chairs upstairs, the place was full despite the major competing demand of the evening -- the World Cup on TV. We got to meet the owner, Kathleen, who was genuine and enthusiastic. 

There are nearly 50 wines on the menu and all of them are available by the glass and the bottle. They even have four wines that are on tap. Prices range from $6-14/glass and three times the glass price for a bottle. Happy hour takes $2 off all glasses as well as the cocktails. The Klinker Brick (California) Old Vine Zinfandel was $13 and the La Vieille Ferme (France) Rhone Rose was $7. Offering happy hour pricing all night for the grand opening was a nice touch. There are 10 cocktails on the menu ($9-10) and all of the house-created cocktails have infused spirits. We tried the Life (lavender-infused Bombay gin, Lillet Blanc, prosecco, lemon twist) and it was perfect for summer -- light and effervescent. There are also a handful of bottled beers available ($5-9).

Pursuit doesn't have a full kitchen but does a great job of making do with several panini presses and offering other snacks like charcuterie, cheese boards and olives/nuts. The make your own sandwiches are fun -- you get to pick your own bread, cheese, spread and topping for $9 with extra items at $1 each. My bacon and Gruyere with pesto on sourdough was a nice light supper and the presentation was darling -- special plates with divots on the side to show the three items in your grilled cheese.

We arrived on a rainy night (thanks Hurricane Joaquin) and found two seats at the middle of the bar. I'd purchased a Gilt City deal for a wine flight that included 5 tastings, 2 bites, and a charcuterie board.

Our bartender was a nice older woman, I think she may have been new. There was also a younger one who served us that last time we visited. There were only maybe 6 or 7 other people there were we arrived.

We ordered our flights and they came back fairly soon as did our two bites, we had the pita bread and hummus and cornichons. Both were tasty and a large portion. Soon after, the charcuterie board arrived but sat there for nearly 20 minutes because we didn't have room for it. Wish they hadn't rushed it out.

The crowd was pretty lively and I soon noticed everyone around us was there to use their deals too, whether Gilt or Groupon. When our bartender left for a while possibly to assist customers upstairs the other one didn't say a word to us. We were deep in conversation so we didn't notice at first. 

Since it was slow my friend tried to engage the bartender in a friendly conversation by asking her if she'd heard of a movie. Her response was ""Umm no"" and she made a face like why are you asking me that. The people next to us even noticed this and said they'd heard of it. I know everyone's personality is different but most bartenders are friendly and engaging, she clearly was not.

Overall, it's a cute place with a nice selection of wine. Also the charcuterie board is A+ and they provide a hefty portion. We even ordered more wine and sat there for a while but still couldn't finish it. I'm sure I'll be back because another friend purchased the deal too.

So in the midst of some of the expected adversity you might encounter on the tail end of H Street NE, The Pursuit Wine Bar is definitely a cozy, comfortable, and unique outpost of normalcy and decency with a fine wine selection, a palatable bear selection with more-than-decent prices, and some yummy grilled cheese sandwiches.  Just watch, in a few years when more of the ambitious plans to develop the historically seedy and appalling end of this corridor are realized, this place will be big.

So just as a tip - try to stay away from the olives, nuts, and all those other little table appetizers as they are nothing spectacular and only add nonsense to your bill.  If you can't decide on a particular wine, there are also beer selections - some of which can be anywhere between $5-$7.  Not bad.  There are more than enough wines for just about any palette - so be patient and you will find it.

Now I will say that I am not much of a grilled cheese kind of person (super boring) but Pursuit has a very unique  menu of Grilled cheese options which is kind of this place's forte (besides for the wine namesake).  Think of how you compile a chipotle burrito - that is the way you do things with grilled cheese sandwiches here.

We arrived around 730 without a reservation and were greeted warmly and sat down at the bar. Including the upstairs -- which is more intimate than the bustling downstairs -- there's a lot of seating here.

They had a good number of variety of wines available, and since this is a wine bar, many people were getting flights of wine. Our voucher entitled us to a free bottle of wine, so we opted for the grenache, which came recommended. It was pretty good. The food menu here is not very expensive. Through our voucher, we were able to try almost everything they have an offer here. There were hits and misses.

The olive snack bites and the mixed nuts snack bites were basically from a can. No extra roasting or seasoning added, so they're a bit pointless. Not really sure mixed nuts from a bag is worth $5. However, the burrata salad was very nice. Took a while for it to come out, but the cheese was very good and the raspberry vinaigrette went well.

The main ""entrées"" here are grilled cheeses. In theory this could be a good concept, but there's a little bit of an execution problem here. Basically, it's just like Chipotle where you just pick a bread, cheese, spread and whatever add-ons you want. But looking at how many options they have, there's a lot of opportunity to just order something that you think sounds good but actually doesn't taste good. A better option would have the menu like how a pizza place would have a menu where you make your own pizzas, but then also have five or six really good creations so that it's easier to make a choice. For people who have trouble choosing your food and making decisions, there are too many options to make a grilled cheese.

Having never been before, we weren't expecting much other than a continuous flow of mimosas. They definitely met that standard and some. I ordered the regular mimosa and one of my friends got the pomosa (pomegranate mimosa). For $2 more, I definitely recommend getting the pomosa instead of the regular mimosa-- the pomegranate is light and the champagne-to-juice ratio is much more balance with it. The dishes overall were tasty. Half of us got breakfast sandwiches and the other half got the frittatas. Can't speak for the sandwiches but the frittatas were rich and filling (don't let their small sizes fool you!). Despite it being a packed house, we got really good service and our brunch extended to a 4-hour drunk fest. Mission accomplished! Definitely recommend coming here.

I had been following this wine bar in articles and updates in anticipation of it's grand opening.  My husband, myself and a good friend actually brunched on H St and decided to make a day of it, so we stuck around to try the new wine bar.  We just so happened to be the very first patrons, which is pretty swell.  We were greeted warmly and was even given a mini tour.  The upstairs is a very relaxed and almost romantic in decor, with many plush couches, loveseats and chairs.  I immediately envisioned a lovely date night spot sitting upstairs.  
The downstairs/first floor is a cute small strip of space with a very inviting bar and one high top table that seats 6.  It seems they thought this through with the options of wine, beer and liquor, with a few local choices and a good representation of wines from over the world. Kudos to making the small list of wines pop and really matter.  
I also want to highlight the wonderful paninis/grilled cheese sandwiches they made to order.  A very great system they have giving the patrons a checklist sheet to order which type of bread, cheese, and add -ons giving the person choosing many options.  Between the three of us, we shared two different grilled cheeses, and they were both great.  I especially appreciated the cute plates and how they were presented with a section for the ""extras"" of your sandwich.  (A slice of the cheese on your panini, the add ons you chose).  
They also offered cheese and charcuterie boards, of which we did not order during this visit, but thought it was an excellent idea and a perfect partner to the wine list.  

Thomas was so nice, Christian was extremely good at selling someone into more drinks with his charismatic charm, and Sara was very sweet and eager to make a great first impression.  In our short time there, about an hour and a half, we saw very few opening day hiccups and we were happy to see more and more patrons filing in and enjoying drinks at the bar. 

We thoroughly look forward to returning and bringing more friends.  We wish this new business the best of luck.  We will be checking in to see what new choices they have in wine, cheese and beer.

He was very knowledgeable and provided appropriate suggestions according to our wine palate.  For the small bites, the olives are definitely the way to go! They were not overly briny or salty.  Just perfect for not overpowering the wines.  We also paid an extra $11 for the combo cheese AND charcuterie board, totally worth it! The board is the biggest charcuterie board I've ever seen! Even for the original price of $30, it's worth it. They PILE on the meats.  The board comes with three cheese, a soft, semi soft, and hard.. also with honey, compote, mustard, butter, dates, etc.. seriously anything under the sun you can think of!  The flights are also quite affordable at $15, and you get to choose over 20 different wines.  I decided to stick to not so popular ones like the Italian and Spanish ones.

2883,Vinoteca,/user_details?userid=hxH9qmT_52uxbZOjUWvwOQ,"I had a hard time giving this place the fourth star, because I have now been what I believe to be five times and the extraordinarily slow service seems to permeate the entire place - no matter where you are (I've dined inside table, inside bar, front patio, and back patio). I mean yes, Sunday brunch hour (anywhere from 11am-3pm) can get crazy... but their lack of attention to the kitchen timing of dishes and general lax approach to service is annoying. All that being said, the food IS good and the drinks ARE delicious. You will certainly need a reservation - and the back patio (which is not a reservation zone) fills up very quickly during warmer days and nights. 

This most recent venture a haphazard group of us ladies arrived at 12:30pm (approximately 5 of us) and yes we had reservations but they could not accommodate our pre-entered request for outdoor seating and we were not about to waste a beautiful day indoors, so we migrated to the unknown world of their back patio. We were luckily able to secure five high top chairs for their ""boccie ball"" bar section. For anyone who hasn't been, they have a boccie ball court which takes up a considerable side of their back patio, and people can watch the court and saddle up to what is akin to a wall -style bar / table. AKA: small and narrow but a workable option. 

When you dine / engage in beverages on the back patio it is a free for all. You have to place all your orders with the bartender who is managing the entire area. On this unseasonably warm day, there was only one bartender and a very packed back patio. Also important to note, they will not honor their brunch-hour bottomless beverage option on the back patio. Alternatively, you can get a $4 mimosa/ Bellini or a pitcher of mimosa / Bellini for about $18. On this occasion, the service was so slow we had multiple members of our five party group asking the bartender about orders. For reference, one girl ordered the lox bagel and she was the first to order. It came out over an hour later. IT'S A BAGEL. I ordered maybe fourth and requested the portobello breakfast (portobello mushroom with spinach and an egg... not worth $16) and it came out FIRST. Everything else was so haphazard in it's arrival I can safely say someone either forgot to place the order or just left it sitting in a kitchen wasteland. We contemplated whether they had to maybe go to a store to buy ingredients at some point because it became so absurd. Also, one of our friends wanted the cinnamon bun .. we were informed they only provide 10 of those per day and at 12:30 were already out. DIDN'T THEY OPEN AT 11AM?! Why even put this on the menu ?? 

So not only were we hangry by the time food did arrive, it was actually impossible to truly eat as a group because of the timing / arrival of everyone's dish. The last dish / order to come out was a parfait... I mean come on people. BE BETTER. At this point, you really are going for the environment (aka: any chance to be on a patio drinking). Again, the food is good... but maybe lower the cost when you are not guaranteeing it's arrival time. We left promptly after finishing our food after we were *finally* able to get the bartender to close us out. Also note: each dish upon arrival came sans silverware... and each time we went up to the bartender and had to wait to be provided with cutlery. 

*All in all... I don't ever suggest this as my first go-to for outdoor brunching. However, their patios are enjoyable once you get past the service.

I ordered the duck confit enchiladas, which were covered in avocado slices, mole, and a queso blanco (I think) sauce.  So tasty!  The duck confit was a wee bit salty and densely packed into the crispy, rolled tortillas (oven baked, I believe).  My friends ordered eggs benedict...one with the duck confit and the other with lox.  They both appeared to thoroughly enjoy their food.  Their brunch beverage specials are pretty nice (bottomless options, pitchers, etc.).

During brunch the waiter was extremely attentive and offered good suggestions on how to pair drinks and customize the food. I would have enjoyed more brunch options on the menu, but it was my understanding that it recently changed and they were giving it a test run for the spring/summer. I ordered the enchiladas which was made with: duck confit, mole, poached egg, avocado, cotija, crema, and cilantro. I was on the fence between this and the lox scramble but ended up being happy with my choice. These were not your traditional enchiladas, the shell was more crispy and they were rolled almost like taquitos and laid on top of a smokey brown gravy. Needless to say they were delicious but may not be what everyone is craving first thing in the morning as a breakfast option. I didn't order the lox scramble simply because it was missing the traditional bagel and capers, so decided to order bagels, cream cheese, and a side of lox for the table as an appetizer which sufficed nicely (this was our waiters suggestion!). My friends ordered the pancakes (pictured), bacon burger, and jambalaya grits. We got two rounds of the hibiscus mimosa pitchers for the table (which were good but a little too sweet in my opinion). Everyone loved their entrees and my husband even raved about his overall experience once we left which he never really does when we drop that kind of money on breakfast. The music was also really nice.... 90s throwback hip hop hits. I'm giving brunch 4 stars because I think they need more breakfast-y options on the menu as most of what we had were heavier lunch dishes. Looking back at the menu it seems like they have now added ""family style Lox Bagels"" as an option for the table. I wonder if this was motivated from our trip?

Now for happy hour. I will give Vinoteca 4 stars because they offer 15+ wines for $5 on happy hour! They even cater to non-wine drinkers and offer a seasonal cocktail. I was really excited to come here for happy hour because the restaurant has a nice secluded back outdoor patio with tables and chairs and a bocce court. If it wasn't for the extensive happy hour menu I would have given them 3 stars because when I arrived at 6:45 (HH ends at 7) it was like dogs in heat outside. NO ONE was seated inside because it was a nice day and there was only one bartender outside serving drinks to extremely thirsty customers. There wasn't enough seating room to accommodate the crowd. I ended up going inside to order a glass of wine and taking it outside where I had to stand. The bocce court took up entirely too much room in the back patio and no one was playing it. My suggestion would be to remove the bocce and invest in a portable corn hole set for slower times.

Or, you can move inside for a more intimate dinner date setting.

The fountain backdrop to the bocce ball court is idyllic, and heck it's crazy romantic. I ordered a drink and enjoyed my friend's company.

I had two Bloody Mary's which were supposedly bacon/habanero flavored ... couldn't really taste the flavor but it was an okay BM and pretty strong so I'm fine with that.

As for the food, I was satisfied.  We had the Duck Confit Benedict and the Steak and Eggs Poutine, both of which I thought were great.

2936,Vinoteca,/user_details?userid=xbW2w1oDMd6u8qgcaxu6ow,"Vinoteca is a small wine bar with a outdoor patio that has a bocce ball court. I had read great things about their wine selection and small bites so I was really excited to bring my two friends here. We arrived around 5:45PM expecting a full house but it was pretty empty. Nevertheless, we went to the outdoor patio to grab some sangria and get a seat overlooking the court. It got packed around 6:30 because of the bocce tournament which was a nice atmosphere.

I had a glass of the red sangria and the white sangria. The red was pretty average sangria with pieces of green apple floating in it. I thought it could have used some citrus. I really liked the white sangria which was a tad sweeter and had strawberries floating in it. My friends enjoyed their pinot grigio,cachaca punch, and rose but we agreed the white sangria was the winner.

Our food accompanied our wine and sangria perfectly. We ordered the pan con tomate and the hand cut fries. The pan con tomate was amazing-- it resembled a bruschetta with perfectly toasted bread slathered with fresh tomato and herbs. It was also topped with a slice of chorizo and manchego cheese. I could have eaten 3 more plates of those....We also enjoyed our hand cut fries which were served with pulled pork, cheese, and chives. Pure deliciousness.

I would definitely recommend Vinoteca to anyone who wants something more local. It's tucked away in a fairly residential area (but still in the vicinity of 14th Street) so it's pretty accessible. The happy hour menu can't be beat!

Reservations are recommended, but arriving early (before opening) works as well. The restaurant also functions as a wine bar during lunch/dinner, though brunch here was highly recommended.

Bottomless Mimosas you say? I'm in! $15 gets you all mimosas you can enjoy without being pressured or rushed to leave so that the table is turned for the next guests. This is key to a pleasant experience. 

We ordered a few dishes:

Wild Mushroom Omelet; ricotta; truffle butter; home fries. Eggs cooked and seasoned well. My wife enjoyed it, although the home fries were a bit over seasoned for my taste.

Pan Con Tomate And Sunny-Side Up Eggs; chorizo de revilla, manchego; mixed greens: sister-in-law enjoyed every single bite. I would have never thought of ordering because chorizo for breakfast - let's face it - sounds quite heavy for early in the AM. Surprisingly, it was not. Mild flavor, the chorizo provided a nice contrast to the sweetness of the tomato. Break the yolk and mix in. Thank me later.

Huevos Rancheros: tomato sauce; black bean; corn tortilla; queso fresco. 5 years ago, I would think any person eating beans prior to mid-day would be absolutely insane. That changed after 'giving' this dish a chance in the 404. I seldom order this type dish due to (1) high standards in the ATL, and (2) constant disappointments over and over again. Vinoteca delivered broke the curse. I ate everything. The cast iron was clean; no washing necessary. JK. But you get what I mean. So. GOOD! Queso Fresco gave it a tangy taste. When I return, I would get this without a doubt. I'm hungry now, as I type. Wash it down with mimosa(s) and you'll be charged for the entire day. In a city like DC, you need a power meal to walk around and enjoy the beautiful landscape.

French Toast with lavender honey and sweet ricotta.  We shared and it was the perfect ending to our ''savory' breakfast. Aromatic thanks to the lavender; the combination of sweet/savory of the ricotta and the toast was exquisite. Definitely order. No regrets.

2979,Vinoteca,/user_details?userid=DPV08Yin75_qlwpprCMnXg,"Brunch. 

Vinoteca showed me what brunch was. It was something I never understood...until I moved to DC. I heard the words ""brunch"" being thrown around in certain circles. Actually huge hordes of my friends were always meeting up for ""brunch"" and disappearing for hours, and as a breakfast food hater, I wondered how is it that people can take up five hours to consume eggs, coffee and a mimosa? 

Keeping that in mind, here is what I learned about this so called ""brunch"" :

1-It's a beautiful excuse to day drink in a socially acceptable place. Case in point, they supply bottomless mimosas. The best deal in this city at $10. It used to be bottomless bellinis, kir royales and mimosas but the menu is now limited to mimosas. It's completely fine with me. The service here is normally so attentive, you actually have to shoo away or discourage servers from refilling your glass. No joke, if you begin brunch at noon, you'll be pretty much incapacitated by 2pm. 

2-Brunch is not as boring food wise as I thought it would be. It's not just limited to eggs, pancakes and french toast. I am actually such a big fan of the sandwiches they offer there for brunch. My favorites are the Egg Sandwich baguette with pulled pork, caramelized onions, palhais goat cheese, and two fried eggs and the Bagel #2 with fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, gruyere cheese, and grilled red onion. Both are served with salad. Sure I could stop by a bagel/sandwich shop and get similar dishes for cheaper, but they definitely don't taste the same. 

3-Brunch is for nature lovers. Vinoteca has a small patio which is awesome for sitting outside on a beautiful summer day (seating outside is first come,first serve).

4-Brunch is a way to take a roll call of all your friends you partied with the night before, therefore brunch connects people and builds relationships. About a good 50% of them will show up in the clothes from the night before (high five). 

And that my friends is brunch. Now I join the ranks of those who brunch, meaning I am drunk by 3pm on a Sunday afternoon and in bed by 8pm.

We opted for a couple glasses of wine, a table full of appetizers and dessert. Here's the breakdown:

The bread for the table: Soft and chewy; a perfect palate cleanser for your wine tasting. You do have to ask for refills since the wait staff isn't the most diligent or proactive about it. 

Arancini: These are deep fried risotto balls filled with cheese. They were good, but not tremendous. Not as piping hot and gooey as I would have liked.

Roasted cauliflower: EXCELLENT. Perfectly roasted and the sauce that topped it was heavenly. Sop that up with bread yo!

Butternut squash and feta cheese fritters: Given the opportunity, I would eat 1 million of these.  

Sarah & Sheri shared the duck confit, which they both seemed to enjoy since the plate was licked clean. (Note: Neither of them actually licked said plate - they're much classier than that!)

Cheese Flight: We opted for the goat cheese flight which was so delicious. A sampler of cheeses, crackers, figs and fruit jams made this a perfect pairing with our wines. 

Desserts were a little disappointing, so if you've got a sweet tooth, it might be better treated somewhere else on U St. If you must though, order one - they're very rich and you can certainly share with your fellow diners. We did not take this advice and ordered two- the chocolate hazelnut tart and the truffles. 

Tart: The crust wasn't great, but the filling was quite rich and tasty. 

Truffles: As truffles, they were ok, but the peppermint topping ruined them. I mean, it's spring - can't you switch over from peppermint to something more seasonal? Perhaps sea salt? Lavender? Anything but peppermint! Even Starbucks knows to rotate that flavor off of their menu after Christmas...

I ended up with the pork-shoulder omelet which was just as tasty as it sounds. My home fries were remarkably delicious, with sauteed onions!

Intimate space, dark woods, corks arranged in the window to emphasize the wine bar aspect even further. Sort of ambivalent about service, it was easier to get the bartender's attention after Sonja arrived. We ended up staying at the bar to finish up happy hour, and the mellow tunes were pretty enjoyable. Aine's right, the lavender soap in the ladies room smells like ""happy.""

Enjoyed a glass of the '08 Sawtooth riesling while I waited, then switched to a '09 Latitude 34 malbec as we ordered food with minutes to spare. Tastes of each were offered despite the customer load. I enjoyed my bison/gruyere/caramelized onion and lamb/feta/roasted red pepper sliders, and the small side salad of organic greens. Flavors meshed, everything was prepared well. Sonja needed help finishing her royal trumpet mushroom crostini, which was delicious but awkward to knife and fork. Salad served on some serious crunch. Looking at Hue's pictures, she got much bigger mushroom shavings! Until we bit into the delicious earthiness, we thought it had been garnished with edible flower petals. I'd get both of our nibbles again, but it looks like they've changed the crostini lineup since then.

Convenient corner location, the bottomless mimosa brunch can be a miss unless you nab Ashley as your server. Home fries were boring, the onions mixed in were pretty greasy. Bagel #2 was decent and filling. Granola was a nice healthy option, but I opted for a pretty satisfying pork sandwich... meat was reasonably tender and the other components were anti-hangover without rendering the bread soggy. I'll be back to try the cheddar grits, grilled cheese, and other egg dishes, even if pork belly's not on the brunch list anymore.

Atmosphere: I really liked the vibe of Vinoteca, modern and antique at the same time, and was pleased that even though the tables were close together, I did not feel crowded or like the people at the next table over were hearing my entire conversation.
 
Drinks:I had a Bellini and it was PERFECT- almost all champagne with just a hint of peach nectar. My friend got the bottomless mimosa option ($15) and said they were great as well (although I did notice that they were premixed in a large dispenser which I found unappetizing, albeit necessary for the amount served during a bottomless brunch)

Food: I am more of a Breakfast person, but I opted for the Chicken Mozzarella panini and was really glad that I did! The chicken was fresh and high quality and there was plenty of cheese. Very scrumptious and satisfying, but nothing that I could not make myself.

Service: The server was excellent! Friendly and extremely attentive, but not annoying or overbearing. 

Overall: I will definitely be back to Vinoteca for brunch or lunch, but I just do not see myself going there for dinner because of a) the location and b) it just doesn't seem like a ""dinner spot""

I went recently for brunch and noticed they'd changed their menu and prices. I like that they expanded their selection which they definitely needed to do, but they could have added some more vegetarian menu options. I mean it is breakfast, throw a few vegetarian omelets on there and call it good. Even their squash and egg sandwich had pork on it. I ordered the huevos rancheros and charred kale side, they were both phenomenal. I've had their French toast before and it is a little slice of heaven for those who want the sweeter side. 

My one pet peeve is that they changed their bottomless special. If I remember correctly it used to be $12 for all you can drink bellinis, qir royales and mimosas. Now it's $18 and you're limited to mimosas only. Their reg mimosa is $4 so you'd literally have to drink 5 to get your money's worth. That said I ordered by the glass and they were excellent. Good champagne selection and not too much oj. 

I love the vibe here too. Everything is always well done, the staff is super friendly and the value is unbeatable (but for the mimosa). Their happy hour food and wine selection is great. Overall they always stock good wines for reasonable prices and their bar tender can always make a good selection. When I used to eat meat I remember their sliders being outstanding which are grilled while u wait on their beautiful back patio. Even their coffee is good and strong.

The omelette ($12) with wild mushrooms, ricotta and truffle butter is amazing. Uh-MAZING, I say! The eggs are light and gloriously fluffy. The housemade ricotta is super creamy and the truffle butter mixed in with the mushrooms brings it all together. There's the option of greens or home fries but really- it's brunch - why bother with greens? Homefries...dfd! I also added an English muffin which is served with housemade raspberry jam. 

It would be remiss of me not to mention the $10 unlimited mimosa/bellini/kir royale option. With the fact that I was driving and I have a ridiculously low alcohol tolerance, I didn't bother to take advantage of this beverage option but you better believe the rest of my table did. 

I should also take this opportunity to compliment our server- she did an incredible job of make sure everyone remained libated throughout the brunch and that we were fed relatively quickly. She was very nice and never rushed us even though it was clear she had a full section with other very hungry guests.

The only complaint I have is that it is VERY noisy. I mean most of the convo at my table turned to science (I was at a brunch with all scientists) so truth be told, I couldn't participate much to begin with. But it was so loud that I (a.) couldn't hear the person sitting next to me and (b.) when there was a conversation topic that I COULD offer some input, I had to shout to make sure they could hear me.

Usually the people that don't have reservations sit at the bar or go to the back where the bocce ball court is. Anywho, I usually order the same couple things when I go which are pancakes, eggs, bacon, and a pitcher of bellinis. The pancakes are HEAVENLY. They're always fluffy and taste like they've been made with cake flour. With the pancakes, you can pick between ginger butter, walnut butter, fruits, and depending on the season, lavender butter. I've tried all of these and they're DELISH! 

Since we're talking about brunch, what brunch would be perfect without mimosas or alcoholic beverages?? Mimosas are $4/glass or bottomless for $18, which I think is entirely too much. I know for a fact I can only drink about 3 mimosas and that's not worth $18.

Well, after studiously eating around a particularly delicious-looking almond for some 15 minutes, I found my plate--with just the one saved almond left--whisked away! A devastating blow. I knew I had little grounds for complaint (it was just one almond...) but I apologetically (read: drunkenly) explained the situation to the bartender in an effort to beg just a single extra almond from them, and lo and behold, as soon as he understood what I was saying, he rushed off and made me a BRAND NEW olives & almonds plate!

The Bellini was delicious and strong so that's a good choice if you want to try something other than mimosas. My partner in crime tried the Duck Confit Benedict and he loved it... though personally I think my huevos were better. He normally isn't a fan of breakfast food but after getting to see that brunch can be savory and delicious, he was converted. 

We only put an hour worth of coins in our meter, so we were pleased when we realized that we had managed to get in and get out in about 45 minutes. 

In conclusion, I really enjoyed Vinoteca because the food was fantastic, the drinks were not expensive nor watered down, and the service was great. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the noise level and the small size.

I went with the Duck Confit Benedict, the Bloody Mary with bacon and habanero-infused vodka, and of course a side of perfectly crisped bacon (I was on ""vacation"", ok?). This benedict is not your ordinary benedict! The duck was cooked well, and added a salty richness that Canadian bacon just doesn't provide!

The rustic bread served as the best vehicle to soak up all that runny yolk from the perfectly poached eggs on top of it.

On to the drink...this is definitely one of the top 3 Bloody Marys I have ever had!

i like sitting on their patio out front

2) a cute patio out back where you can play bocce with a decent amount of seating.  it gets crowded and noisier at night

3) good cocktails.  whoops, i have never actually had wine here?  if you don't count the sparkling stuff.  should maybe remedy that since it's almost the name of the restaurant.

Vinoteca is the kind of place I like - it has a laid-back unpretentious vibe, it's dressy casual, the waitstaff is attentive and friendly. It feels like a place you could go to hang out with girlfriends, a place you could bring a date, or a place you could take your parents for a nice night out.  The only downside is that it's not an acoustic-friendly place, and even though the dining room was only about half full, it was really loud.

The green tomato gazpacho was absolutely amazing - served with avocado, cucumber, and radish - it is the perfect cold soup for a steamy DC August evening, and it was flavorful and bold without an overpowering taste (sometimes I find gazpacho is too citrusy or too tomato tasting - this had neither of those problems).  The pasta of the day was a garganelli served with tomatoes, olives, and cheese - though I found the overwhelming taste to be fresh and clean, it also felt oddly unrefined, or perhaps too simple - I kept wondering if there was something that could be added to give the dish a punch so that it didn't feel (or look) like something I could make at home.  The chocolate flight (dark chocolate with sour cherry, white chocolate ganache, milk chocolate truffle, dark chocolate with pistachio) is deeply, deeply intense- if you're a dark chocolate person, you are likely to find yourself in a state of ecstasy.

An egg, on top of thick toasty french bread, smothered in hollandaise .

True story, the food was really good. I ordered the eggs with the toast and hollandaise  and alfafa sprouts (random, but still really good), and my bf and I inhaled them like a hoover vacuum.

This Sunday I went to Vinoteca for brunch.  Although I brunch most weekends, the only thing I consider myself a connoisseur of is shrimp & grits and steak & eggs. Since they don't serve shrimp & grits, I got the steak and eggs. 

It was, by far, the BEST steak and eggs I've ever had.  Most places don't season their eggs but here the eggs were seasoned!  The steak was very tender and seasoned to perfection. The salsa verde added a unique favor combination to the dish.  I'm pretty sure that's what made it so special.  It was served with carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms which were all just as tasty as the steak!  The only slight criticism I have (which is the same for any place other than a steakhouse) is that my steak was slightly over cooked. I ordered a medium-rare steak and got medium... which is fine. 

I also ordered a side of grits and they were creamy, cheesy goodness. I'm sure if they did serve shrimp and grits, they would be fantastic too.  The grits were really great.  I got the bottomless mimosas which were a great deal. We sat at the bar and the bartender kept the drinks flowing well into the afternoon until 4ish (they stop seating for brunch at 3!)

Unfortunately, we missed Happy Hour, but were able to secure ourselves a table in the front outdoor area. The restaurant was crowded, and a lot of the clientele appeared to be twenty to forty-something hipsters and professionals looking for a place to mingle, and be seen by others. I suppose my new friends and I fall into this category, as well. Nonetheless, since I had a big lunch, I opted for wine and a snack instead of a traditional entree. Since I was so impressed by its medley of subtle yet enduring flavors, I had two glasses of a complex, full bodied pinot noir crafted at a vineyard in Oregon. For a snack, I decided on the Mozzarella sandwich made with roasted squash, kale, and fig preserve, all on a ciabatta roll. While I tend to dislike kale, I thought all of the other ingredients sounded fantastic. Fortunately, I enjoyed my snack enough, even though I felt disappointed by the decidedly ""European"" portion size. Our waitress was helpful, and the host or perhaps he was even the assistant manager, whom I met earlier in the evening while waiting for my friends to arrive, was extremely informative, and even let me look at both the Happy Hour and the regular menus, in addition to the wine and cocktail menus, to bide my time. He also informed me the Happy Hour policy of not seating parties who are only interested in drinks and snacks. Luckily my friends both ordered hamburgers, which qualified as meals. Overall, I liked the sophisticated atmosphere of Vinoteca, I feel if this restaurant was a genre of music, it would be jazz. The U District is a bit further into D.C. for me, but since I love so many of the independently owned stores on U St., and frequently visit the LGBT Community Center, hopefully I will be back soon, to sample a more substantial item on the menu.

We arrive by 11:00am and the place is empty--my buddy is gagging since the last time he was here it was jammed packed.

The Good
1) Drinks and Be Merry! On Sundays, $10 bottomless mimosas, bellinis, and kirs
2) Bar service. The bartender kept those mimosas coming too. I don't even know how many I actually had. Which is a positive to me lol but if you're not much of a drinker maybe opt for one. Because I definitely left buzzed. They do NOT skimp on the champagne here either.
3)The menu. I had salmon and eggs. It was salmon actually cooked in the eggs. Kind of like a gourmet version of a very country breakfast my mom used to make. It was very good but a little on the salty side. My friend had a very light and fluffy french toast with strawberries. The breakfasts don't come with many sides so it can get a little pricey. But I enjoyed my meal thoroughly.
4) The vibe. Everyone in the crowd looked good and seemed determined to have a good time--even if it is midday on a Sunday. So it seems like a good place to meet friends. And Im sure the bottomless drinks don't hurt.

BUT...
The Bad
1) Space is a problem. It's small and tight in there. And as more and more people find out about the Sunday brunch, it stays packed. My friend and I waited 30 minutes just for a space at the bar to open up. The table wait was over an hour. Even some of the people who made a reservation ended up waiting.
2) Brunch is from 11 to 3 I think. And then they don't really serve food from 3 to 5. So if you stop in during that time period or close to the end of brunch, like we did, the kitchen will close on you. 

All in all, more good then bad. I think it's a really good Sunday outing for a few girlfriends. It's a bit too noisy for a date if you ask me. But I left walking a little crooked and satisfied!

Our server suggested that our plates come out 1-2 at at time to really appreciate the flavors of each dish, and I have to admit that I was impressed with everything we ordered. Usually when I go to a restaurant that only serve small plates, there's at least one dish I'm not too fond of. This didn't happen at Vinoteca--each dish was flavorful (esp the mixed mushrooms). the meats were tender (pork belly ftw!!), and the cheese was to die to for.

For $75, my mom and I got a four course meal, cute party favors, and a bottle of sparkling wine. Not too bad! The atmosphere was just right for the occasion. 

We started with a complimentary tiny ginger drink with cranberry sorbet, delicious. I started with Boquerones, which I learned are white anchovies, on a brioche. This was fresh and delicious. Next up was a prosecco and apricot risotto with shrimp. This was probably the lowest point of the meal - the shrimp didn't seem to have basic seasoning and neither did the risotto. Where was the apricot? Not sure but missing in action were the prosecco and the salt and pepper, too. I didn't mind too much to tell you the truth because the service was outstanding. Our server was super kind and patient. She was really nice and just very attentive. The whole staff was very attentive and even though it's a prix-fixe, I felt like they truly cared about my dietary restrictions.

Next up was the swordfish. Not a huge fan of swordfish but it was not too bad - kind of like tuna. After that, I got a cheese plate and that was so good. I loved everything about this. The cheeses were very well-chosen. Next, I had a table of mini-desserts. The chocolate truffles were amazing!! I'm a huge fan. 

The food was maybe not the best I've had but for the price, we got a really cool atmosphere, a nice four-course meal served with the utmost care (everything looked absolutely gourmet), a bottle of sparkling wine, a cheese plate, and AMAZING service.

I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here.

And in the two visits, since my last (you remember... the one where I needed the semaphore flags to get the BT's attention before happy hour ended...?), I've developed quite a knack for getting what I want, when I want it. 

I arrived at 6:38pm. That is twenty-two whole minutes remained in the five dollar happy hour. Tonight, as I arrived, I did all the smiling, waving, cheek-pressing, hello-ing, and how-do-you-do's as I made my way through the crowd to the bar. Yesssss! Ooooh! I have the BT's attention! Yes, a montepulciano and an old vine estate zinfandel please! Thanks! Yes, a salmon slider please. (When did everything become a slider? Can I get a full size sandwich please? Dam.) Sawbuck rendered. Change given. Tips!

Mmmmmontepulciano...is...mmmm..big and juicy...full of the flavors of black cherry, blackberry, and black currant. I want to marry this wine. Mmmm. The old vine zinfandel is another story. I need to volatize its esters multiple times before I am even ready to drink it.

The salmon slider: meh. I can make my own; better; and more satisfying for the same money at home with the leftover tail of salmon from a previous night's dinner. But I'm here, eating vinoteca's so I won't complain.

When the crowd thinned (everso slightly) I snagged a seat at the communal tall table to order more food: the arancini and the sea scallops with house-made cuttlefish ink linguini. Yum. But know this: there were only two scallops per order and three arancini per order. At $12 or $14 per (respectively) this is not a good value for ""small plates"". Fancy preparation and obscure fish ink ingredients notwithstanding this is fish and rice. Not complaining. Just want others to be aware of the quantity of food they'll get for the cost. Just saying. The taste of the food was delicious I might add.

The point I'm trying to make here is: Vinoteca is expensive. Go during happy hour for the best value. I'm not cheap. Although I'm sure many would beg to differ on that point but whatever. I do appreciate a good value for my money and the small plates here at Vinoteca are not. As for the wines, they are improving. And the pours are on point so I'll give them a solid 3.5 stars for that. Throw in the half star for facial recognition and there you have it.

The food was a revelation, both in terms of quality and value.  We shared a prosciutto and several small wedge's of sheep's cheese( endearingly referred to as the ""sheep flight""), nicely presented with crackers and apple jelly.

Service - top notch.  The place is run well from the top on down.  Paul is a nice guy, and Jarrell makes sure everything is running smoothly.  Vinoteca is also home to 2 of my favorite bartenders in DC, Christi and Horace!  

Be sure to stop in and say hello to them during happy hour, which runs from 5-7 on weeknights and includes 20 different types of very nice wines for $5 per glass.  You cannot beat this deal if you are a wine drinker.  They also offer small plates for $5 during happy hour, which includes a nice selection of different small sandwiches, roasted olives and almonds and other delectable snacks.

In addition to the wine, they also make good use of their limited number of tap handles by carrying a nice selection of craft beers.  Some recent ones include Victory Headwaters Pale Ale and Scrimshaw Pilsner.  There is also Peroni to cater to the bocce crowd.

Speaking of bocce - they have a bocce court on the back plaza!

I recommend this place for happy hours, in general though, as their wine for $5/glass cannot be beat and their small plates are also reasonably priced and flavorful. I've sampled three of their mini-sliders (lamb, bison, and crab) and these were pretty delicious. Overall a comfortable and accessible establishment.

We happened upon it and were pleasantly surprised to find a relaxed, affordably priced venue for weekend day drinking. A few Kir Royales later and a chat with the gregarious, knowledgeable staff, and we were sold. On a subsequent visit to DC, we went back on a Friday night in an attempt to have a night cap (or two), but were repelled as Vinoteca was packed, loud and even the outdoor rear space, which had been pleasantly quiet before, was overflowing with people. With that, we exited, but we fortunately ended up there again on my most recent visit for brunch.

Vinoteca's number one draw with brunch is the whole ""unlimited"" mimosa scheme, and may I commend them for making it truly an unlimited occasion. I stopped by with two friends on a Sunday not long ago, and we were really very pleased with the entire experience. Their brunch menu presents an impressive, thoughtful offering of solidly prepared dishes which make a great meal alongside all those mimosas. I went for the wild mushroom omelet which was superb, and my friend's cheddar brioche eggs benedict looked great. Service for brunch is superlative, and the friendly, welcoming vibe continues. As I mentioned, refills on our coffee and mimosas were almost comically fast, and the waitress was patient with our lingering/taking forever to order, then to finish our meals (isn't that what brunch is all about?). Overall, I'd say Vinoteca is high on the list of places worth stopping by for a great (boozy) brunch with some delicious food.

The prospect of a nice glass of red wine kept me chugging through the snow.

My friends and I were pleasantly surprised to find out that all the $5 glasses of wine served for happy hour extend all night on Mondays!  The bar tender helped me pick out a glass of their velvety Malbec which danced to a tune of happiness on my tongue.  We decided to sit at a table (table seating is offered only if you're ordering food) and ordered the sweet potato gnocchi and a variety of cheeses to snack on while we chatted.  The sweet potato gnocchi came with wild mushrooms and pecorino cheese.  The dish was lightly flavored and good but I don't know if I would order it again.  We also ordered the Oveja sheep's cheese, pecorino grand cru sheep's cheese, and their substitute for the midnight moon goat cheese.  I recommend the Oveja.

It also just so happened to be a bar participating in the Yelp Drinks Week and so I ran into a number of Yelpers later in the evening.  I felt like I was cheating on Yelp, but without all the remorse.

Anyway, regarding the Vinoteca.  Being that it was happy hour there were about 20 different wines that were on special for just $5, but being the rebel that I am, I opted to drink Lagunitas IPA that was also on special.  The bar itself isn't all that big, but is larger than the ""dining room"" that is in the back.  For our HH event we had a lot of the area taken over and so there a bit of a crowding issue.  I doubt this place is that packed every night for HH, but the servers still made their rounds to us, taking our orders and being pretty prompt.  

Being a wine bar, it wasn't as stuffy as some of their wine bar restaurant friends, which I appreciated.  I didn't have a chance to try and food, but the pork sliders looked excellent.  Overall it is a place I would be willing to try again, although, with Solly's next door, its always a tough proposition.  Oh well.

I think the combo of ingredients just doesn't work well together). 

I had the Chilean Cab and it was fantastic. We also shared the chocolate hazelnut tart, which was faboosh. 

The place doesn't get 5 stars for a few reason:
1) The butternut squash fritters...should be removed from the menu.

I made the dinner reservation for 6pm, and got seated promptly in the main dining area upon arrival. As I was the only patron in the area that time -- most of the people were either at the bar or the patio -- it wasn't very loud at all. The servers were attentive and the dishes were served in a timely manner. I was feeling fancy, so I ordered their special menu with the wine pairings. The amuse bouche (I forgot half of what's in it, but it's some kind of creamy dressing containing shiitake mushrooms, duck, and other stuff) is quite creamy, and a bit sweet for me. I like the first course, which is some fried cheese and pear salad. The main course of bison ribs in some wine based sauce, served with mashed potatoes is definitely tasty and cooked towards medium rare. I haven't had bison before, so I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a bit chewy and best served on the rare end -- the cartilage was still red. At least, it was soft and cooked enough that I can slice the meat easily with a knife. I do like the sauce although I think it is a little sweet for me. I was happiest when they served the dessert (maybe because I was a little bit tipsy from the wine?) -- I absolutely love anything with chocolate in it! Overall, the food is okay, nothing extraordinary. The servings were a little small but for a three course meal, this would fill you up okay. On the other hand, the wines were excellent, and they complement the so-so food quite well. The wine for the second course was pretty strong for me, which is probably why I was a bit tipsy afterward.

I think the place is worth visiting again. The ambiance seems to be more suited for a group of friends trying out the wines. I'll definitely check out their wine flights on my next visit.

Steer clear of the marinated peppers, though, as they seemed to be just swimming around in oil, and came with two thin slivers of flatbread... it was slightly confusing on how to eat them (put the peppers on the bread? Eat them one by one with a fork? Drink them straight out of the bowl? Ach, what a challenging life I lead).

It doesn't seem to be a place for vegetarians, with duck confit, bison steak and rabbit fricasee anchoring their menu. indeed, its only concession to vegetarians seem to be a rather boring dish of farfalle with truffle butter/oil and microgreens and some salads. 

Although I haven't tried it yet, their charcuterie selection is appealing, with the ever-luxurious jamon iberico on offer, as well as the divinely-salted speck and lusciously fatty coppa. The availability of jamon iberico suggests that they buy their hams and cheeses from Cowgirl Creamery, and so will probably be good quality. 

The wine menu is intimidating, divided into sections according to the varietal, along with ""blend"" and ""unique"" categories. There are three prices for each list--a 2 oz taste, a 4 oz glass, or a bottle. Prices range from $3.50 to $15 for a taste, $7 to $30 for a glass, and $28 to a spasm-inducing $120 for a bottle. Twitch. 

I ordered the seared scallops with baby green pea puree and prosciutto crisps (cauliflower puree and truffle oil during winter), and split an order of bison sliders with gruyere and caramelized onions. Both dishes were good--the pan was not hot enough to sear the scallops adequately, but they were otherwise well-cooked, fat, tender, and lightly sweet with the gorgeous snap of the salty prosciutto. They went well with my inexpensive Benvolio pinot grigio ($7), which was dry with a lychee note. The bison sliders were tasty as expected, but not satisfyingly-so--they aren't a patch on a full, hefty burger from Granville Moore's. 

Dessert was a baked chocolate mousse with sour cherries--a molten chocolate cake, in essence, with the dusty deliciousness of bittersweet cocoa, gooey on the inside. We also ordered a thoroughly devastating sticky toffee pudding with creme anglaise and what appeared to be cocoa nibs, the highlight of the meal. 

The only downside was how loud the restaurant became as it filled up. Around 8:30pm, a flamenco guitarist and dancer started performing, which would have been fantastic if I were there to get some drinks with people, but made dinner conversation a little difficult.

First, their drinks.  Great wine list, and the servers and bartenders actually seem to know what they are talking about.  Their wine-based cocktails are fantastic across the board (and I've had them all).  I most highly recommend the fig/red wine drink.  Yum.

Happy hour food: sliders.  Tuna, portabella, beef.  Perfectly cooked, complimentary, delicious.  

Dinner:  whatever I've had has been unremarkable, but not bad.  Dinner is not my favorite of the Vinoteca menus.

Brunch:  $5 bottomless mimosas.  Yes, $5.  Enough said, right?  But, add to that the great food:  try the cheddar grits, the blueberry pancakes, or the applewood bacon, cheddar, and egg sandwich with salad greens.  All of it perfectly balanced, well cooked, and well-priced.

Service:  I heart Barbara.  She's the best, but everyone whom I've encountered there is friendly and competent.

I ordered the bison with gruyere cheese and carmelized onions and the lamb with feta and roasted peppers.  Both were very good. The meat was cooked well done yet the sliders were so juicy.

My only comment to the Vinoteca space is that I wish they had more tall bar stools so that some of us didn't have to spend so much time standing.  The other thing was that the water tasted like it had a strong chlorine/bleach smell to it.  Blogger Mango and Tomato felt that it was too strong.  I figured it was just the treatment that DC water gets but some restaurants have been able to deal with this by using water filters.  I hope Vinoteca does the same.

I've been here twice so far: once for brunch and once for dinner.  8 of us met for Sunday brunch at this place and were one of only two groups in the whole restaurant.  Still, our plates took 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen and the portions were small, even for about $8 per person.  But in the end it was worth the wait -- my tomato, spinach and feta omelet was one of the best I'd ever had.

The serving time for dinner on a second visit was even longer; an order of sliders and a rabbit fricassee took nearly 40 minutes to come out of the kitchen.  But both the waitress and manager were very apologetic about the delay and offered us a complimentary round of drinks and cheese flight, so we didn't mind as much.  

And did I mention that the food was incredible once it finally did arrive?  The rabbit dish featured the fluffiest gnocchi and the perfect sprinkling of fines herbes, and you MUST try a couple of tuna sliders if you are in the mood for something lighter.

This was advertised as a tasting of three different champagnes -- what we got was three full glasses of champagne, simultaneously.  That's right -- a small table with FIFTEEN glasses of champagne on it.  It was a sight to behold.   A lovely sight.....

Perfect for just a tasting!  We had unlimited refills on the plain bread basket, so really there was more than enough to munch on.

I'd probably had an OD of champagne by this point, because I laughed hysterically at the bizarro presentation.

All in all we had a lovely time, with plenty of alcohol. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, though less so as the place filled up.  Which it did.  And it became extremely loud.  Even at our tiny four-top, I could barely hear the girl two seats away.  Just a warning to people like myself, whose hearing has gotten more sensitive with age rather than less :-)

We decided to brave the heat and dine outdoors. Our waitress was really friendly and helpful with the menu. I started with a Bloody Mary with pepper infused vodka, it was spicy and seasoned to perfection. I could have spent the rest of my life drinking these! My boyfriend ordered the Michelada which was quite interesting; beer, tomato juice, lime, spices, salt. It tasted like a watered down Bloody Mary mixed with a flat beer. I don't recommend it unfortunately. I wasn't quite sure what to get between the french toast or the pancakes so the waitress recommended the pancakes with ginger butter and fresh berries. So delicious! The ginger butter was a great addition too! My boyfriend ordered the Ivernia Irish Cheddar Omelet with a side salad. I thought it was excellent but nothing more than a really well executed cheese omelet. The service was really great in the beginning but kind of dwindled by the end, I think they were just really busy. No big deal. Location is great and the prices are decent.

I do want to let you know up front that I know several of the people who work in the kitchen as I used to work with them at Brasserie Beck's. The fact the one of the Chef's came out and chatted with me didn't change anything other than it was good to catch up with him. 

The space is cool, a little loud but I think in a space this size it is always going to be like that. Other than that we both really love the place. 

The food was really good - we started with a glass of champagne - well I did :)  We ordered a small plate of shrimp and grits and I have to say that when it comes to grits I am so picky going up in the south I had them all the time and so it is a standard for me to check things by. If you can make good grits you score with me. Well they scored big time. 

The whole dish was amazing! I could have just had that and been very satisfied. But we moved on to bigger plates and better things.  My girlfriend order the special which was Kobe beef with shrimp and I had the house made bow tie pasta with truffle butter sauce and summer truffles shaved over it (no skimping on the truffles either I might add) 

Let's just say neither one of us had anything left on our plate. We hated it so much we decided that could not have dessert but it arrived and let me tell you. 

How we found room I am not sure but WOW made us so very happy! We had the Panna Cotta with strawberries and something else was on the plate but I don't even think I tasted it as the Panna Cotta just made my taste buds wanna go home with the chef it was that scrumptious!

I had ordered the Eggs Benedict Vinoteca, and he ordered the French Toast and a side of scrambled eggs.  We had to wait a bit for the food to come out at all, and when it did, my order was fine, but he was handed a plate of scrambled eggs and a plate of plain toast.  He told the person serving our food that he had ordered French Toast, and when the server came over he made NO effort to apologize.  I tried to wait a few minutes but mine was getting cold, and my friend got more and more irritated.  Finally he called the waiter over and told him to forget the order, he didn't want it anymore.  It was only then that the waiter mumbled something to the effect of ""sorry about that.""  But it was a big enough mistake that he should have been apologetic from the start.  I think if he had been, my friend would have been fine.  Brunch was probably only 3 stars based on that experience, but the food itself was good, as was the fresh squeezed OJ.

My prior experiences here as a wine bar were good enough that I feel more forgiving about the less than stellar brunch experience.  Their happy hour is pretty phenominal--a great selection of wine for $5 a glass.  The service is usually very attentive, and the atmosphere is nice without being pretentious.  The small plates that they offer along with the happy hour are nice, as well--the sliders are really good.

It was probably the caramelized onions that added awesome flavor, but the textures overall were great together.  The bread, cheese, onions and mushrooms everything was very good, tasted fresh.

3533,Vinoteca,/user_details?userid=4xOo4s80P1oRDTBN0il_Yw,"I finally made it to Vinoteca last night after totally wiping out on Mass Ave because of the ice and also voting.  Not that falling on my ass has anything to do with the restaurant, just trying to drum up some sympathy.

I'd been intending to go for months, as it is mere blocks from my house and I would loooove to have a great local wine bar.  Because of the cold and ice (did I mention how I fell?) it wasn't too crowded.  In fact, I think only one table was seated, but most seats at the bar were full.  So the slow/absent service that seems to have plagued many of the reviewers was not an issue for us.  In fact, we had excellent service, as the general manager was filling in for one of the bartenders and paid us plenty of attention and silly compliments.

The decor is a little bit off--the shiny red diner-style tile pillars totally do not go with the rest of the concept.  But decor doesn't really have much effect on me.

While I love wine, I do not in any way pretend to be a sophisticated consumer of it, so the wine list was fine by me.  I love that there are SO MANY by the glass selections, and that you can get a taste-sized pour.  I was a little confused by the new world/old world division, as there were some European wines under new world and some North and South American wines under old world, but I'm not exercised by it.

My friend and I ordered about four different wines between us, and enjoyed them, though  I can't remember all of them.  I know I particularly liked the Valpolicella.

We ordered cheeses, all except the last one on the list (a goat cheese that sounded like your average chevre).  For $2, we actually thought the servings were *quite* generous.  While we did run out of bread, we had no trouble getting more.  My favorites were the Red Hawk, a brie-like soft cheese with a complex, almost spicy flavor, and the gorgonzola, which was creamy and not too stinky (I personally love stinky cheese, the bluer the better, but a milder flavor is good too and here the tradeoff between sharpness and dryness was perfect).

All in all, I had a great time and will definitely be back.  I'm sure I won't love it as much on a crowded night, but I want this local bar to make it!

**edit**  I went back on a Saturday and of course the experience was very different with the crowds than it was with an empty restaurant, but I'm still a fan.  We had the bad/slow service other reviewers have suffered from; at the end of the night the waitress even said, ""Sorry you guys had such a bad experience here tonight.""  But since I've never been a waitress and it looks like a hella hard job, I try not to be too judgmental about it.  Things got to us...eventually, after much prompting.  The cheese menu was differen than it had been--cheese servings were $3 instead of $2, and three-cheese tasting flights were available.  I'd say skip the tasting flights--the cheeses cost $1 more, the servings seemed smaller, and the minuscule ""accompaniments"" did not add adequate value for the extra dollar.  Order a la carte.  I still maintain that based on comparable cheese boards in the area, the servings are generous and the prices low.  Compared to the grocery store, sure, expensive.  But compared to, say Sonoma, as good or better.

Upshur Street in Petworth is becoming quite the drinking and dining destination these days:  Petworth Citizen, Hank's Cocktail Bar, Timber Pizza, Himitsu, and most recently, Ruta del Vino.  As the name implies, this place is Latin American wine focused.  Its corner space is large and airy with a centrally located bar island and black pressed-tin ceiling.

The smoked octopus appetizer was great, and the choripán (spicy chorizo sausage and bread with chimichurri) was good, but different from what I'm used to.  Rather than a hot dog bun or roll, it was served on ciabatta, and at $16, a little pricey for what amounts to a sandwich.

Their interesting selection of South American wines avoids the usual suspects and includes an Uruguayan Nebbiolo and Bolivian Tannat.  However, as others have noted, the pours appear rather small (probably around 4oz).  They would do well to either 1) increase the pour size, or 2) downsize the stemware so that 4oz doesn't seem to be just a splash.

Steamed clams with potatoes, pork belly and grilled corn.  It's served with bread, but they server also brought us spoons...you'll want to slurp up every bit of this perfectly balanced broth.  We also had the fish tacos, which were good, but after the clams ""good"" was easily forgotten.  For our main we opted for the Parrillada Mixta for 2.  Since there were 4 of us, I'm glad they let us order the smaller portion (since we had so many other things on the menu) the larger portion would have been too much.  The meat was all perfectly seasoned and cooked (hangar steak, confit chicken and house made chorizo and smoked sausage) but what surprised me were the smoky grilled onions and poblano peppers.

The meun is quite extensive with ceviches, tacos, sandwiches and entrees. I want to come back again to try more things.
As someone else said, the service is the weak spot. It could be friendlier and faster, but they are new and so busy ,so hopefully that will improve. It wasn't horrible or rude, but it could be warmer for such a cool neighborhood place.
But otherwise what a great addition to the neighborhood.

Like their name suggests, they have a massive wine list and a pretty good cocktail list to go with it.  I went here for brunch and they also have a very good brunch menu too.  

To start, I had the made to order cinnamon rolls, which came in a tiny cast-iron skillet.  They were good, but had maybe been a little overlooked on one side, which had gotten a little hard. Regardless, I would recommend them and order them again myself.

Next, like a true millennial, I got the avocado toast and it was very good.  It was avocado and toast topped with olive oil, crushed pistachios, and sea salt.  It was two layers of avocado, so the bottom layer got a little plain, but the top layer with all of the toppings was delectable. 9.5/10 would recommend.

Next, our waiter treated us to an on the house side of skillet biscuits and gravy, since we had to wait a little bit for our reservation, and I am so thankful he gave us those because I wasn't smart enough to order them myself. You now, should be smart enough to order them because the biscuits were perfect fluffy and soaked up the creamy gravy surrounding it, which wasn't too thick, which is how I prefer it.  The sausage was also very good and to double down on that, I had also ordered the house made sausage as a plate.  So both were very good.

Lastly, I had the fries, which were probably the biggest disappointment of the meal, because they weren't as crispy as I prefer and I really disliked the house made ketchup, which I believe had a curry powder in it.

Regardless, I would highly recommend Cork for brunch and likely for dinner too or even for just a casual drink and snack.

I love Cork!! First, I'm already inclined to like it because it's a wine bar. So you'd expect them to have great wine, and they do, but the food is also fantastic. I came here for brunch with two girlfriends.

Food: 5 stars
BEST avocado toast I've had at a restaurant. I know, that's a big statement, considering that avocado toast is becoming as common as salt & pepper at restaurants. The hook & sinker are the pistachios and pistachio oil, which add a flavorful nuttiness, + the requisite sea salt that heightens the flavor of avocado immensely. All atop perfectly grill bread. MmMmM! So good. 
Other stand-out items that we ordered were the cinnamon rolls (comes with 2), the biscuits, and the housemade sausage.  

Drinks: 5 stars
It's known that cork has a fantastic wine selection; however, we didn't have wine at brunch. We had the Thyme 75 cocktail which was made with gin, thyme and grapefruit. It was light & refreshing-- perfect for our sunny patio brunch.

Atmosphere: 5 stars
Comfortable, & inviting, yet sophisticated. It still feels like a classy place without being stuffy or fancy. There's a small outdoor patio with 4 tables, or you can sit in the cozy inside. 

Service: 4 stars
Our server was very nice. He explained the menu to us-- that it's share plates and they recommend 2-3 per person (we got 5 for the 3 of us and it was the perfect amount). The service was on the slower side, but as long as you're not in a rush and can enjoy the delicious food and drink, you're all set!

Price: 4 stars
$13 for the avocado toast is pretty standard. I think the price of the drinks ($12 for a brunch cocktail) and cinnamon rolls ($7 for two small rolls) is a bit steep, not totally out of the range of DC prices. One cocktail each and dividing the food came out to $38 each.

Let me start by saying our server was fantastic. He was very attentive and went above and beyond to make sure my boyfriend got a cocktail he would like (not a huge wine drinker). So we were very happy with our service! 

The food on the other hand was hit or miss. First, I ordered the calamari and shrimp which was described as ""peppered"" with lemon. I kind of assumed it was grilled, so I was surprised that the dish came out fried--a fact that wasn't mentioned on the menu. I suspect it was because they want d to disguise the fact that the dish was 90% calamari, and we counted only 3 shrimp. Misleading and super disappointing. There was so much fried breadbox on the food I picked it off. 

On to the other dishes. The sautéed mushrooms were drenched in butter, and therefore delicious. I would have liked to have had crispier brussel sprouts but oh well. My boyfriend had the hanger steak. While it was well cooked and very tasty, it was pretty small. 

So overall a fine experience for a first time dining at this establishment, but we both agreed we wouldn't come back for dinner--just drinks.

Despite having spent multiple days per week in Logan Circle for well over a year, Justin and I never made it to Cork together, generally opting for new restaurants or spending the evening cooking together instead. So when Carol, Jenn and I finally picked a date and time for a girls happy hour - a feat more difficult than it sounds - I finally had an excuse to visit Cork. We started by grabbing a glass at the bar where the bartender was informative and helpful, pouring samples before filling the glasses. All wines by the glass are within the $8-16 range with most being $10-13 and there is a decent sized selection of roses and whites in addition to the breadth of reds.

We didn't have to wait long after making our selections before a table was ready and we ventured outside to sit on the patio. It helped that it was still early, before the main rush of dinner, but it was key to order a beverage at the bar since happy hour prices aren't available outside. Two small tables were pushed together for our party of three which allowed for ample room for the shared plates, though the tables were a bit wobbly. Jenn insisted we get the avocado toasts (avocado, pistachios, toasted pistachio oil and sea salt over thinly sliced grilled bread) as she'd had it before, and it did not disappoint. In fact, I loved it so much that I've replicated it at home for a quick and easy weekend breakfast. We also split the hangar steak (with roasted fingerlings, mustard greens, salsa verde), duck confit (with frisée salad, tilston point blue, pickled cherries) and a couple of other dishes. 

Our meal added up quickly and seemed a bit pricey, especially considering it was originally just happy hour snacks that ended up turning into a full meal, but the food and wine were good and the company was even better. It's evenings like this that you take a bit for granted until you're far away and realize that a splurge every now and again is more than worth it to have some much needed girl time. 

Of note, Cork does have a Sunday brunch from 11-3. Some of the menu items are the same as the dinner menu but they also have breakfasty items and some pastries that look really good. Or maybe bacon cheddar scones just sound absolutely amazing because I haven't had pork in three months.

While a fan of Yelp's filtering and suggestion system based on an area and review, I'm also a fan of using DC Eater's 38 list to help assist on restaurant suggestions.  I've passed by Cork on countless occasions and finally made the decision to check out what it was all about.  Needless to say, it made for an awesome friend filled Sunday brunch.

To start out our brunch my friends and I decided that espresso and cocktails were an absolute must and highest on our priority list.  I ended up going with the 'Devon's Sweet Brown', a slightly sweet rye whiskey cocktail that I ended up ordering 2 more of, enough said.

For our eating please we went with the avocado toast, house-made sausage, french fries, crispy polenta, duck confit, and farm egg soft scramble.  The avocado toast was probably my favorite, a simple dish of avocado, pistachios, toasted pistachio oil, sea salt on grilled bread.  The house-made sausage was also very good, not too overpowered in spice, but subtle and enjoyable.  The egg soft scramble was very simple but also very good.  Perfectly scrambled eggs with crispy bacon (my favorite) along with some toast.  One of the more complex dishes in terms of flavor profile and texture was the crispy polenta.  The tomatoes along with the polenta and poached egg were all very good together.  Most likely my least favorite dish unfortunately was the duck confit.  I just wasn't a huge fan of the richness of the duck along with the crispy polenta and egg.

All in all, this meal was relatively simple in terms of ingredients, but was really quite tasty. Ultimately, somewhat more of an impressive feat.  I also can't help to acknowledge how much the company of friends helped to play a part in making the meal that much more enjoyable.

Always consistently delicious.  Loved the composition of ingredients.  Superb!!  

4.  We had the selection of (3) cheeses:  Cloth bound cheddar,  Brillat-Savarin and a cheese from Spain..forgot the name but it was a lovely cheese.

When we initially made the reservation, the maitre d' told us that they didn't make outdoor reservations for the late evening.  when we followed up to move our reservation up 30 mins (not for outdoor seating purposes, they put us on the list for outdoors anyway.  Our server, Julio, had a great sense of humor and always seemed to appear exactly when we needed.

The food was spectacular.  Cork serves small plates designed to share, and there was always enough to leave you wanting more but not too little to feel cheated. (Side note: my gf and I were very amused by the fact that it caters to couples, but 2 of our 5 dishes had 5 of the item on the plate.)

As far as food, we had:  the avocado bruschetta (really delicious), the roast chicken (delicious), the asparagus (delicious), the eggplant flatbread (our favorite of the main course), and the tortellini (delicious - yes, a pattern).  For dessert, we had the Creme de Pot (awesome) and peach and blueberry crisp (excellent).  The only feedback (not a complaint) is that many of the dishes were salty (but not overly so).

The kitchen turns out surprisingly good fare. We shared calamari, a delightful avacado on toast, and charcuterie: the San Daniele prosciutto, Hudson Valley duck salami, and Palacios chorizo (the trio was $15, a good deal). The duck salami was satisfying to render, the chorizo a must-try, and the chorizo's pronounced, smoky flavor made me curse in wonder. For drinks, a friend and I both sipped Prosecco wine flights - creative, fun, smooth - netting us three glasses each.

3734,Cork Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=z_Qh9GJUY5HVNMJhJtaTsg,"The high points of Cork are really fantastic, unfortunately there were a few snags along the way that kept them from being a really spectacular destination for me, which is unfortunate since it's about a block from my doorstep. I don't know if we actually even intended on dining at Cork, but after a pretty disappointing tasting at the Cork Market just up the street our palates were already whetted by the acidity of crisp Spanish white wines, and when Elle suggests going to eat somewhere how can anyone say no?

When we walked in I instantly loved the vibe and the look of the place, very reminiscent of some sort of artisanal French shop turned into bar. There are a few tables around the perimeter, but there's no denying the bar takes center stage here, even protruding out into the main dining area with an extension. We arrived just after 7 on a Friday with no reservations and were told it would only be a quick wait, so we sidled up to the bar and grabbed a glass of wine. Before we could even pay the hostess informed us they were clearing off a table already, very surprising, but pleasing, given the lack of reservations on a weekend. Don't let that fool you though, this place is always packed when I walk by, so do anticipate a wait.

The brief prelude we had at the bar allowed me to quickly take in their wine list, and although I was quite impressed by the size of the by the glass options, I wasn't all that thrilled by the actual content. We both remarked that nothing really jumped out at us as intriguing (until later in the night when we noticed a Pinot Grigio that alluded to saffron and lime, which I still think has to be bullshit), but it's really nice that they pour you a sample of anything you order before you commit to it. I went with a Rose, one of my favorite summer indulgences, and was surprised by the still pervasive strawberry notes (these usually fade quickly after their Spring time release), and Elle chose a Pinot Noir which was drinkable but not all that great.

When presented with the choice of dining inside or out we quickly jumped on the chance to sit on the patio. Inside the bar was somewhat noisy, and it was actually one of the most beautiful days in months, so we couldn't pass up the opportunity. The patio seating is a bit claustrophic, but once you start eating and drinking you quickly forget what's going on around you. The food provides perhaps the easiest juxtaposition of quality at Cork, with some things being done wonderfully and others falling very flat, although they all sound incredibly appealing on the menu.

The first course to arrive was the grilled sardines on a bed of lettuce with a bit of red pepper, and that description is essentially where all the good part stops. These were bland, tasted nothing like sardines, and the only redeeming factor was that they had been de-boned for you. I really only recommend this dish for people who like the idea of fish but not the actual taste of them. Next out was the rosemary chicken liver pate with bruschetta and pickled shallot. This was Elle's choice, and by the end of the meal she forgot we even had it, if that tells you anything about the impression it left. For me it was slightly less pleasant than that, even, as I didn't think the rosemary helped enough to liven up the harsh minerality of the liver.

The two following dishes however completely redeemed Cork, even if they were the cheapest of all the things we ordered. At $7 for a tiny bowl of mushrooms it might seem like quite a hike, but these were prepared beautifully, preserving so much natural mushroom flavor but elevating them quite a bit with the addition of madeira and marjoram. The fries are tossed with parsley, garlic, and a heavy amount of lemon zest, something totally new for me, and now rank near the top of my favorites in all of DC. The housemade ketchup with just a hint of spice definitely helps the combination pull together nicely.

We wrapped up the main portion of the meal with the duck confit, a quizzical pairing of tradition and nuance, with its addition of roasted spaghetti squash, cranberry compote, and pumpkin seed oil. The duck meat itself was flaky and tender, with a great golden crust, but the accompaniment just fell flat. If anything I liked the cranberry compote, but only because it helped me forget the little strands of squash which were forgettably bland.

Prior to dessert we each took another glass of wine, and the second time around the selections fared far better, with a delicious Grenache based Cotes du Rhone for me and some of the grand Royal Tokaji dessert wine for Elle (which they surreptitiously snatched up too soon, but replaced with a full glass when I complained). Neither of us were big fans of the warm apple crostada, with salted caramel, and vanilla bean Calvados ice cream, because frankly we barely tasted anything other than the hint of apple. The ginger-caramel Pot de Crème with candied pistachios however was magnificent.

Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and ready to make suggestions about anything on the menu: wine, cheese, food.  We both really appreciated his comments and feedback...even steering us away from the wrong direction when we originally ordered something that he thought was a bit lackluster in comparison to his recommendation.  I appreciate that type of honesty in a server.  I had the seasonal Australian Sparklers wine flight (2 white and 1 rose).  They were pretty dry and increasingly sweeter which paired well with the meal.  My only qualm was that because it was a wine flight and it was sparkling wine, I wish that each of the wines came out separately rather than all at once.  Because my last wine had been sitting out for the entire meal, it had lost most of its bubbles and was less sparkling as I am sure it was intended to be.  

Dishes are meant to be shared and they have a mix of both cold and hot plates.  We ordered a selection of 3 cheeses.  My favorite was the Bucheron (which tasted like brie--it was delicious) which was also served with a raisin nut bread and a red wine reduction with honey glaze.  It was a perfect pairing.  We also ordered the duck salami from the charcuterie which was salty but delicious and the foie gras.  The braised kale was the highlight of the entire meal--perfectly cooked (tender but still crisp), roasted garlic, and a parmesan-like cheese on top.  It was delicious!  Finally, we ordered the duck confit (although in hindsight, I think I would have preferred to order something a little bit lighter--like maybe one of the seafood choices).  It was cooked perfectly...very juicy and served with some frisee, strong cheese (tasted like a gorgonzola) and cherries.  Overall, the dishes were tasty, well-paired, and plated beautifully.  The small little touches like candied hazelnuts or spiced nuts were great.  Everything was ever so slightly too salty, however.  So, by the end of the meal, I was munching on white bread just to clense the saltiness out of my palate.

-The space is nicely broken up, so that you feel like you are eating in a more intimate setting, despite the fact the place itself is deceptively large.
-For the food, the chicken liver pate was the clear stand out (more so than the avocado toasts).  The main dishes we tried (the duck and the brioche sandwich) were really good (although not great).  Still, we liked all the dishes we ordered and we ate a lot (not realizing the generous size of the small plates).
-For the wine, the flights they offered were a really great way to try several more expensive glasses.  And the progression was really good and matched the courses that came out (I made it to my sweetest wine going into dessert).

either way, i'd be more than happy to make my way back to cork whenever i find myself wandering about the 14th st corridor.

The menu puts a special emphasis on fresh, local, seasonal ingredients and showcases them well.  The grilled asparagus on salted toast was simply spectacular.  The flat iron steak was hands down one of my favorite dishes.

Wine selection is great.  Nightly, they offer a selection of different flights that allows you to try a variety of wines in one sitting.  It's not a new concept, but it is something limited to wine specialty restaurants and the fact is that there aren't many of those.  The wine menu itself affords an opportunity to be a little adventurous and try some obscure wines you might not find anywhere else.

Yes, it is crowded and obscenely difficult to get a table.  That should tell you something.  People come back and wait in line just for the chance to eat here.  Don't let one or two sour grape reviews on Yelp dissuade you.

The service is definitely imperfect.  Unfortunately the wait staff is not always familiar with the extensive wine list and the food seems to come out from the kitchen at random moments.

We live around the corner and when Cork first opened, we went a few times.  Since then, it's been harder to get a table and they only take reservations for very early or very late times.  

So we pretended that we were with our grandparents and ate at 5:30.  There were 10 people in our group and most had babysitters, so 5:30 wasn't really a problem.  

Since the opening, the menu hasn't changed a bit, but that's OK, because we like the menu.  Other reviews complain about the hostess, but they must have fixed that because our group was seated within 10 minutes of our reservation and everyone was very polite.  Our waitress was also very attentive and the service was good overall.

Suggestion: get multiple orders of the pistachio/avocado Bruschetta.  

The biggest surprise though was the price.  We had expected it to be much MORE expensive than it was.  Based upon the wine choices and the amount of food, we expected $100pp, but it came to only $65pp.  Not sure how that happened, but we didn't complain.   

My only complaint was that we were seated upstairs and it was HOT.   Not hot as in when people say ""that's hot,"" but hot as in when people say ""I'm sweating because it's so hot.""  It was not as bad downstairs.

My dining partner had already begun drinking a cab so I hopped into a Portuguese rabigato, which was tasty but a bit more acidic than I was hoping for - although made more delightful with our first course, a cold plate of smoked trout with an incredible shaved fennel salad (more vegetables should be julienned, I argue).

Fork-tender, perfectly seasoned, perfect temperature (might have helped that we were sitting NEXT to the kitchen, so we got our courses record fast) - all you could ask for in a cheek, albeit a tiny portion.

The food here is outstanding, and some of the things I've tried, I literally dream about. The avocado toast is a MUST have, along with the calamari and rock shrimp. I'm not a big calamari fan, but Cork's is cooked PERFECTLY. It's not at all chewy, and is melt-in-your-mouth good. My other favorite dish is the flat iron steak.

i decided it would be best to ask our much nicer server, travis, what was up with the photo policy. he said it was a rule they had since opening:: no photography. something about someone trying to replicate recipes. really? i'm asian. i take pictures of food. it's kind of what we do. and how the hell do you figure i'll be able to replicate a dish from a single photograph?! are you going to swab out my mouth to cleanse my tastebuds so i can't figure out how much salt or avocado oil you put in that dish as well?

The first step of my master plan to fortify my good BF position was a dinner out at Cork.

We had never been there before, but I had heard plenty of good things.  I called ahead for seating, but that was unneeded as when we arrived at 7:30 the place was only marginally crowded and had plenty of tables for diners.  The bar area was packed, but we were interested in eating in addition to the wine on this fine Thursday night.

The best dish we ordered was the avocado pistachio thing on warm bread.  Two flavors i would have never thought to marry worked beautifully.  The flat iron steak with its anchovy dressing was also a surprise party in my mouth.  I'd never tried pork cheeks before, but i wasnt too impressed.  The meat reminded me of what you would find in goulash and not something that is considered a delicacy.

To accompany, we ordered flights of the white wine and the chilled Italian red.  All six 2 ounce portions were great, but we particularly liked the first two servings of both.  Flights are a great way to get a little taste of very different wines and we wrote down a few that we will have to try and find bottles of later.

Between the four tapas style dishes, two flights, tax, and tip, we spent about 90 bucks, which isnt awful, but the place is definitely not a one $ kind of place like Washingtonian would have you believe.  The hostesses and server were awesome.  After we finished our food we were offered another round of drinks which clearly meant our server didnt mind if we stuck around for a while.  I like that as opposed to her trying to get the table turned as fast as possible.  We declined and paid, but i appreciated the gesture.

3891,Cork Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=8nbDv8fBzO0xMWT09SMk7A,"Summary: Crowded, a bit loud in front, but quieter in back, and great food and wine. 

Cork doesn't take reservations, and though you can call ahead, on a Saturday night you can pretty much count on an hour wait (even with a party of only 4 people, like we had). It's nice to have a glass of wine at the bar, though the chances of actually getting a spot at the bar are fairly low - it's usually packed at least two rows deep, so that you have a bit of trouble ordering/reaching and are also in the pathway of waiters traveling back and forth to tables. We did manage to order a flight of Spanish white wines to share while we were waiting, which was very good. (They had four flights to choose from.) There are some tables up in front where its very crowded, but luckily we were seated in the back where its much more calm. The food is all tapas style (each about $7-$10), with about 20 different items on the menu. Amazingly, we were able to find 8 items to share that we all liked and that worked for Jeff's cousin, who is vegan. The Avacado was one of my favorite dishes - it's avocado, pistachios, toasted pistachio oil, and sea salt all on grilled bread. The asparagus was also great - with ricotta cheese and also served on grilled bread. There were wild mushrooms and also a dish with chick peas in safron that was very good. The cheesecake (shared) and a cup of coffee were a nice way to finish the meal. It's definitely a place I'd try again, though maybe on a slower night.

3893,Cork Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=Q5eEQGcTD4qIXgyDASVZOQ,"First, I love wine and I love small plates.  I also love to drink a little more than I should and then be able to meander home on foot.  For me Cork delivers on all counts.

It has plenty of wine offerings by-the-glass, largely from Europe (which I have to say is a nice change for someone from California who is really only used to having easily drinkable West Coast wines as options and has never been forced out of her comfort-zone since she started seriously appreciating wine).  And the food, it's tapas, both cold and hot, come with plenty of vegetarian options (I'm a meat-eater, but one of my friends is not), with the right-sized portions (enough to split by 2-3 people when getting several).  I can say that I haven't had a dish that I wasn't a fan of yet.

I would chalk this up to being today's prototypical wine bar, right down to the exposed brick walls, barely enough room for squeezing through, and acoustics not conducive to casual convo.  So, yes, it's the near-perfect wine bar.  It gets four stars because I'm still comparing most bars to AOC in Los Angeles...well, no, not really (that wouldn't be fair).  Actually there are some things that could be improved upon.  For example, I'd rather have olive oil than cold butter with my yummy, chewy-inside/crusty-outside bread.  I'd also like to have them adjust the wineglass size depending on the wine (i.e., a Bordeaux size for those bigger-than-life reds that need tons of room; I am always able to ask them to pour my wine in those, and they do without hesitation) if only because they have so many large European reds to offer.

Again, for those looking for an intimate wine and tapas experience, you should probably go on an off night (not sure when that would be, but I would guess Sunday or Tuesday; they are closed on Mondays).

This review is strictly for the bar, however; I didn't have any of the food.

I think I'm in the mild throes of new love with the bartender, Tom. I'm not sure I was in a state to accurately judge this, but he may have made me the best cocktail I've ever had. He's not bad to look at, either.

Having just come from the bar at Cedar (review to follow), I wasn't really in the mood to keep drinking - until I tasted my friend's drink. I don't recall exactly what was in it - it tasted gin-ny, lemon-y, star anise-y. Yum.

Later, as I was surveying my options behind the bar, I spotted a bottle Cynar, which I had been wanting to try for months. I asked Tom to make something with it, and I was thus presented with the most awesome and perfectly blended drink I've had in recent memory. I know it involved bourbon, Cynar, and a spiced syrup. I believe there were other ingredients as well. I'm getting hot and bothered thinking about it. Any bartender who knows how to make a drink like this is alright with me (see April's ""How to get in my pants"" talk thread).

I didn't think about it at the time, but it's also pretty impressive to get cocktails of this caliber from a wine bar. I'm amazed that this is the space that used to house Sparky's. It was wonderfully lively without being crowded.

Their flights are a fun way to explore their cellar, even if last night they disappointed with the rose and the rhone; the cava flight was well received, but bubbles find it easy to please...

The biggest problem Cork has is crowding, and thus their table policies; we aren't so punctual a town that refusing to seat ""until the entire party is present"" makes sense.  I'd rather they increased their price a touch and relaxed that policy, so that Cork wasn't a chore, as much as it is a pleasure.

Another is that (apparently from now on) you have to reserve a spot in their tastings with a credit card (so far so good), by filling out a word document with all your credit card info, and then mailing it back to an AOL address.  That's incredibly sketchy, and I refused.  A web interface to prepay for tastings is fine, an open table reservation that requires a credit card is fine, but I wasn't sure if this wasn't a member of the staff engaging in a little opportunistic identity theft!

Not every meal is perfect, but we always enjoy the wine and our favorite dishes (e.g., the avocado on bread).  We happily put up with long waits standing in the narrow corridor between the front of the restaurant and the back area / dining loft, or cramped with others by the bar.  

So, it was a measure of my disappointment with last Friday's meal -- our first in a few months -- that I feel compelled to post this update to my initial review.  

First, the service:  I've never had a problem with the front-of-the-house staff or with the waiters here.  They've always been polite, professional, etc.  But our waitress on Friday night was noticeably, oddly brusque.  She deposited our menus in front of us and asked if we'd been there.  When we said yes, many times, she then proceeded to explain the restaurant's concept and that dishes were served in small plates as if she hadn't bothered to listen to our response.  My husband ordered one of the wine flights.  When she arrived with the flight, she slammed the glasses onto the white paper ""coaster"" containing the descriptions of each wine without a word of explanation or a smile, then left.  Such was the tone of her ""service"" throughout the meeting.

Second, the food:  It was not up to its usual standard.  Even our favorite avocado/pistachio on bread standby wasn't as good as usual (the bread was very thinly sliced, and two of our pieces were actually burned).  The sauteed kale, which we've gotten a number of times, seemed underseasoned (lacking in salt?).  The braised pork cheeks were tasty, but one dish we were trying for the first time -- halibut with a pea puree, mushrooms, and bacon, was not successful.  The flavors did not work together and the bacon was way too fatty (and trust me, I do not mind a piece of fatty bacon).

Cork has a lot of potential, though it seems clear to me they are still working out the kinks.  I'm also not sure the wait staff has fully adapted to the menu, but again, that will probably change in the future.

Wine:  All wine is old world, so don't go looking for big zingy California reds.  I thought the list was more e than extensive and it had some lesser known wines that I was pleased to try out.

So, a $30 bottle would probably cost closer to $10-15 if you were to buy it in country.  I always find this slightly depressing.

Menu is divided into small hot and cold plates.  The plates are small, so for two people you need to order a total of  four (at least).  Cost per plate runs between $7-15.

Food:  My friend and I split four plates.  The ""cold"" were: 1) a smoked trout plate, which included sauteed fennel and some arugula; and, 2) chicken liver pate with grilled bread.

The ""hot"" were: 1) grilled flat iron steak, which included sauteed Brussels sprouts; and 2) sauteed mushrooms.

The hot plates were both excellent.  The mushrooms were a real stand-out.  The pate was also great, but you don't get enough grilled bread to finish off the ramekin's worth of pate.

The trout was lackluster.  One problem was that by cooking the fennel, most of the anise flavor was cooked out of it.  A much better use of fennel would be to serve it sliced paper-thin, lightly dressed with a mild vinaigrette, and topped with shavings of an aged pecorino.  Or, if they insist on cooking the fennel, they should add the slightest touch of sugar at the end of the saute to highlight whatever anise flavor lingers.

The biggest problem was that our food was served in what I consider to be reverse order.  Instead of beginning with the more delicately flavored cold plate of smoked trout, the first thing to hit our table was the robust steak.  We'd basically finished the steak when the mushrooms arrived.  By this time we'd run out of bread and had to ask twice for some more.  Finally the trout arrived.  Actually we didn't order the pate until after finishing the first three plates and realizing we were still hungry.  

My three star rating is relative to what Cork strives to be.  I do recommend the restaurant since the food is pretty good; and I myself plan on returning.  If progress is made,  I'll raise my rating to four stars.

We came here on a Saturday night (4 of us) and even though we called ahead to get on the list we still had to wait roughly an hour and a half to get seated. This was frustrating because not only was there no room to wait but it was impossible to get to the bar to buy a drink while we waited. The hostess was really nice and handled the sea of people very professionally. 

However, when we finally got seated everything was worth the wait. Every dish was flavorful and cooked to perfection. We ordered: calamari, lamb shank, steak, a sampling of cheeses and meats, brussel sprouts, brioche, the tomato sandwich, and the chocolate torte. 

The cheese and meat platters were fantastic and you choose what you want so you can't go wrong. The lamb was SO tender. This was probably everyone's favorite dish. The tomato sandwiches with goat cheese were yummy and the chocolate torte was gone in literally 3 seconds. I would def not order the brioche again - it tasted like your basic grilled cheese sandwich but it was missing something that we couldn't put our finger on. The brussel sprouts were ok (too much sauce) but I think I'll try something else instead next time. 

Add a bottle of wine to the list and the bill came out to $180. This is def pricey but the food is fantastic. If you're looking to go somewhere on a date and you're trying to impress I suggest this place.

3961,Cork Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=igEjBH3NoDkdVZSrC_Xg2g,"I've been to Cork twice, not including the times I went in and decided it was too crowded to bother waiting. Here's my take: It's cool and new and has been packed since Day 1 and they're a bit overwhelmed. But I suspect that in a few months, it may calm down enough to be a nice neighborhood spot Sun-Wed.

My first experience at Cork was lackluster, but the second time we had a really great server (tall Asian guy-- I think his name is David) and that made all the difference. Also, it was a night when they weren't freaked out and super busy. We ordered wine at the bar and within 10 minutes got a table.

I have to say I love the crazy garlicky fries and the homemade ketchup which tastes a bit like tomato chutney. I also love the calamari and rock shrimp. We ordered the duck sausage which consisted of five ridiculously thinly-sliced coins of sausage. And we had a couple of cheeses. And also the trout with the onion-fennel compote (tasty). 

ALL OF THE DISHES ARE INCREDIBLY SMALL. I say this as someone who goes to New York fairly often and drops $100+ on a tasting menu of tablespoon-sized portions. So I am not opposed to the tiny plate. However, when we're talking about  a $5 side of fries, it should be enough for two people. We shouldn't have to order extra (which we did)-- it's fried potato, not truffles or foie gras, people!

Will I go back to Cork? Yes, I'm a whore for trendy places that overcharge me for root vegetables. And I love old world wines. And it's in my neighborhood. But I probably won't go on a Friday or Saturday.

Apparently they were rude to my friends before I arrived (which went away when the owner realized he knew one of my friends). Other than that everyone was good. Our server was reasonably competent with a decent personality and I usually had water.

The wine was really good. We picked some nice bottles. We also ordered just about everything on the menu. For the most part, everything was delicious. Cheese plate, good. I thought the romaine hearts were predictable and over-dressed, but others raved. The trout was good, what little there was. Sunchokes were a good highlight. I wish they hadn't done the mussels (why does everyone feel a need to have mussels when they can't do them properly?) and was a little annoyed that the server recommended them, despite my warnings of high standards. I heard all the meat was really good. French fries are a must (nothing that special, but hell, they're there and the homemade ketchup doesn't have high fructose corn syrup).

Chocolate torte and apple-walnut crostada delicious.

The space is awesome, I love the three separate dining rooms, and the bar has a great extension that accomodates a 4/5 person group, which I think is pretty cool.  They do need a second door at the front 'cause it gets a bit drafty with everyone coming in.

The wine list kind of pissed me off, the prices were great, but the list itself was just not very intuitive, I found the way it was presented to be a bit pretentious.

The servers are totally flaky, and when I say flaky I mean I think they all enjoy the wine a little too much.  Not to mention, they weren't very good at recommending the wines, and could barely list the specials.

Otherwise it was the usual small plates, not enough food for being a bit overpriced, very DC.  The dishes were all pretty good, the lamb was very well cooked, the portions for mussels and fries were incredibly small considering what you can get at neighboring restaurants, and I totally disagree with the other reviewer, the home made ketchup was really good with that touch of cumin.

3982,Cork Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=ZPcfIlaUDS2EJvqiGjGRag,"It was a rainy, chilly Saturday night in September, and Carolyn decided that the lucky restaurant to host her birthday dinner would be Cork, on 14th St NW between R and S St. I had never been, so this was pretty exciting. I was sick with a cold so I was a bit nervous about how long I would last - I was like a video game character and my energy bars were disappearing at triple speed.

We got there at about 7:50pm, and of course, the restaurant was PACKED. I mean, every table was full , the bar stools were all taken and there were many many people squeezing themselves into every nook and cranny of the restaurant while waiting for a table. Since they don't take reservations, we had to wait for a table to open up and for a table for eight, it was going to be a while. As we stood by the bar to order drinks, I noticed 2 gigantic glass jars, one full of a colorful medley of olives, and one of mixed nuts. I made up my mind then that we were going to have olives, and fortunately most of our friends agreed. There were delicious scents rising to meet our hungry noses as we stood around sipping on wine and scotch. Their wine selection is vast, as expected in a wine bar, which made Carolyn, a wine enthusiast, quite happy. They list their wines by color and then by region, and I think we had all tried something different and all were satisfactory.

After about an hour of waiting, we were taken to a table toward the back of the restaurant, which was lovely because it was much quieter than the front. Honestly, my expectation for the food was low since Cork is a wine bar, but looking at the menu, I found myself saying, ooh, this looks good, this looks good, this looks good...ooooh, THIS looks good...um, everything looks really good. So then a crazy thought crossed my mind and apparently Carolyn's also - there were eight of us, so we could possibly get one of everything on the menu - mind you, we were starving. And it would have been perfectly affordable - I did the math and it would have been under $30 per person!! Then reality bonked us on the head and we began to eliminate a few items.

The olives were delicious, especially the big black ones, yum. One of the best things I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth (ooh that sounds kinda dirty) is the avocado on grilled bread with chopped pistachios and toasted pistachio oil. It is so simple yet sooooo good. The calamari was also quite good, the batter wasn't overwhelming and the remoulade complements the lemony, crispy calamari wonderfully. Oh and the french fries, oh my gosh, it's all garlicky and the house-made ketchup is amazing with a hint of cumin. My absolute favorite of the night was the duck confit - it was crispy and melt-in-the-mouth tender, wow, suddenly I'm hungry. We also tried the sauteed wild mushrooms, which was way better than expected, with a nice meaty texture and a delicious sauce. Grilled pork tenderloin topped with fried lemon and mustard greens was definitely a hit - the fried lemon was a surprise, it provided a nice contrast to the pork and the bitterness of the mustard greens. The only glitch in the evening was not getting the right cheese on the cheese platter and having to wait 30 minutes after we were done eating for the brussel sprouts (not my fave, btw, too much butter - I know, that's impossible, but in this case its true), but in the end, with lots of good wine and wonderful company, it was a fabulous evening, even though I was exhausted from coughing. We ended the feast with a cookie platter, port for the fancy Crow sisters, hot chocolate for Maris and me, and scotch for Andrew.

I think Cork is wonderful. I'd definitely go back for the duck confit and the avocado on grilled bread. You know, I should try making the avocado on grilled bread, I don't have pistachio oil, but I think a good olive oil will do just fine. Oh, so I totally forgot to take pictures of the food...I was sick!! I'm sorry, my mind wasn't working right!! I'll do it next time, so if you wanna go, call me! Tasty tasty!!!

White-fleshed fish is sometimes bland, but this was so perfectly cooked, seasoned, and absolutely delicious I refused to give a bit to my companions. The cheese offerings are also high quality, a must at a wine bar; they don't shy away from offering powerful triple-cremes and pungent blues. Bread, cheese, and wine might be the only three food groups I need...in which case, Cork, can I move in?

Nice selections, if not obscure. We had a delicious white from the Piedmont and with it cheeses, wild mushrooms, and calamari (which came with a garlicy, herbed cream dip which was just OK). For dessert the grapefruit financier was less than thrilling, and unfortunately one of the pieces of cake still had parchment paper stuck to the bottom. 

This being said, the service was superb (when I was forced to order a more expensive armagnac digestif because they were out of my choice, the server brought a portion that was nearly double a normal serving) and I can't wait to go back and try out the ambience inside.

4044,Cork Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=EsbZIKEgXIuvINN9Fs9uIA,"To call Cork merely a ""wine bar"" is maybe not giving enough praise to a talented chef in the back. The review I read  in the WSJ got me psyched for the wine, but all I can think about now is the delicious food. It is cozy (crampt?), unique, quirky and even if the wines are sometimes hit or miss the food is actually superb and certainly not to be underestimated. 

Wines don't go over the top. I was slightly bummed about the wine list and my un-knowledgeable server, but chalk that up to teething issues (Cork just opened and appears very jammed) and I think it still deserves between 3.5 and 4 stars.

The wine list is all old world, and truthfully it can be confusing, even to someone who knows a little about wine. I am always eager to explore and the new grape varietals were a pleasure, in addition to some really interesting and complex wines that remain on the glass list. I must admit that after trying about eight glasses some of the wine on the list by the glass was indeed mediocre, but that's the way it goes.

Food: Delicious. Amazing? I didn't try the whole menu, but we ate a lot. Caesar salad. Mussels. Olives. Steak. Duck. Kale. Roma tomato bruchetta. They were out of calamari, but I wanted to try it. Had more food that I can't remember, but they are very fond food memories indeed. Whoever is the chef is at this place is a talent and the food here is recommended even if you don't like wine. You must try Cork if only for the food. GO!

If there is any minor complaint it is that I was disappointed slightly by the wine and the servers' knowledge of the wine. I was set up bigtime by the WSJ review of this place, whose wine writers I really respect. Maybe they are just so experienced with wine it was very fun for them to find new, different and crazy varietals. But to me some of the wines indeed weren't that great, and the help also wasn't too knowledgeable, unlike the WSJ experience. I enjoy wine, drink and buy it often, and was very disappointed in my waiter's knowledge of basic French wine questions (got confused with regions in Burgundy). Descriptions of wines (and cheese for that matter) I was unfamiliar with were ridiculously vague and unhelpful, but my waitress was so nice I didn't want to ask for another (I can't tell you how many times I heard ""it's full bodied....slightly more than medium bodied...it's not full body...""). My impression was go here for a fun, but not blow-you-away, wine experience. Go for delicious food, a great atmosphere, interesting grape varietals, fun people, an energetic spirit and the chance to try something new with friends.

Finally, I can't stop talking about the food: YOU MUST TRY THE CHEESE. If you like blue the French on the separate cheese menu is nearly perfect. You can select 3, 5 or 7 types of cheese from the cheese list...and the menu is a delight to pick from. A pepper-laden goats cheese from Michigan (very interesting). A pungent cow's milk cheese from California. You will be a happy person if you only eat cheese and the raisin bread, possibly washed down with a glass of their cote de bonne pinot.

the food is ok, everything seems to come with bread, maybe to sop up the wine? We enjoyed designing a cheese plate (the almonds that come with it are delicious -cumin and cinnamon?-yum. I do not recommend the eggplant. the fries were so so. on the other hand, do get the tomatoes, which come on bruschetta with dots of basil and goat cheese. 

for me, the fun and highlight was the wine, all of which we selected by the glass. I considered the flight option and intended to find out the pricing for this, but forgot (too much wine!) Yet i enjoyed my Spanish grenache-tempranillo, as well as a French red, the grape i cannot remember. As i enjoy Argentine and Spanish wines, it was nice to get the chance to step into a new region for a change.

At first I thought the chicken liver had an odd after taste, but when paired with the shallott marmalade, I could no longer detect it and felt the dish was complete.

The happy hour vino is $7 a glass- a steal as most of their regular priced wine is not below the $10 mark. And it's very good wine. The happy hour bed is $5, happy hour cocktails also $7.

AND they have a pretty extensive happy hour food menu too! Not the small, sad items you typically see- full size burger, full size gourmet grilled cheese, two types of tacos, meat and cheese board, etc! All at the $9 or less price point.

I have to start with a nod to the quality of service.  Our server was extremely nice, made exceptions where the menu said there were none (I'm referencing restaurant week restrictions), and was always on top of drink refills.  He also made extremely accurate food and wine pairing recommendations.  One huge drawback was that we did have to wait longer than desired for our food, especially for being on a Friday afternoon after the lunch rush.  It was a good 30 minutes before our appetizers came out, and the entrees were staggered so some of us waited for the rest to come out before eating.  There were 8 of us, so I'll give the benefit of doubt.

The soundtrack was on point!  I had to check if it was one of my Spotify playlists, because they hit all the favorites.  Everyone at the table commented on the music, which is not something you usually talk about.  Perfect ambience for a Friday afternoon lunch.

To say goodbye to 2015 I chose Slate, and despite a few minor hiccups, it proved to be a solid choice.

The ambiance of the place is nice, very low-key with just some framed corkscrews of various types for decor, and whoever's Pandora station they were playing was very hip, a bunch of electronic remixes of indie rock songs. The staff were all friendly and welcoming, quick to refill a water glass and constantly checking in to make sure everything was good. The only glitch with the service was a seeming inability to time the arrival of my wine with the food, twice arriving after I'd had several bites and once well before the course came. A very minor inconvenience though, and overall everything went very smoothly.

The food was all delicious, nothing too daring but not boring choices either. The starter of fish roe and some kind of spread on a slice of baguette was a nice amuse bouche, salty and savory but not overwhelming. The appetizer, duck egg rolls, is apparently a popular specialty of the house, and with good reason. The main course was the most traditional, a simple petit filet mignon au poivre with mashed potatoes, and their chef knows how to cook a filet properly to the point of melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The dessert was some chocolatey crunchy layered concoction and I should have asked for the recipe, it was that good. The wine pairings with each course were spot on, perfectly complementing the flavors of the dish, as you'd expect from a wine bar. Aside from what I thought were slightly small portion sizes and wine pours (the whole meal was $40 plus $20 for the wines, so you get what you pay for), my only quibble was that the mashed potatoes had gone lukewarm when they arrived and the dessert was still cold from having, I assume, been prepared well in advance and refrigerated.

Overall this was an excellent way to close out the year, and I left feeling quite satisfied. I suspect the little nitpicks I have were mostly a function of having chosen the early seating, when the kitchen is likely still getting into the swing of things in anticipation of the main event later on.

Otherwise Slate is a good choice for lunch or dinner if you happen to be in Glover Park.  Its a good place to go for a date night or a low key happy hour as well.

4103,Slate Wine Bar + Bistro,/user_details?userid=nlqwYAcsDOeON71B-y-NNQ,"When I purchased a Living Social deal to come here, I was really excited about the prospect of getting to try a new wine bar in the area. I'm always surprised that there aren't more of them around this city, so any opportunity for me to sit back and enjoy some fruity deliciousness is alright with me. The setting is relaxed and simple, and the service was very friendly on a late Saturday afternoon. 

Unfortunately, after looking at the prices, we decided we could really only swing pre-movie drinks and an appetizer. The food was not unreasonable for the Glover Park area, but the drinks were pretty significantly pricey, and if you're at a wine bar, it's pretty likely that you want to be drinking. That being said, it's important to remember that these wines are specifically chosen to be sustainable, so it's very likely that they cost more to begin with than would those at a more typical wine bar.

My fiance and I ordered two flights of wine -- one of the standard white wines and one of the standard reds. In fairness, the portions were big enough that we could share all six wines we got and decide which individual ones we each liked best. We mixed and matched whites and reds and enjoyed relaxing with some good wine and conversation. To put a little something in our tummies, we also ordered the baked brie, which was absolutely delicious. Our waitress even acknowledged that there probably wasn't enough of the crostinis to match how much cheese we had, so she brought us out some extra with no additional charge. 

Everything we ate was really enjoyable and we loved the laid-back atmosphere. We would definitely come back for their regular or late-night happy hour, because those prices look more manageable for our budget right now and the dishes offered look fun. I also really would like to return for dinner as they had some delicious-sounding vegetarian options on the menu; in that case, we may just have to go small on our alcohol consumption. Either way, would definitely come back here to enjoy another meal or a few drinks while in the Georgetown area.

The entrance is a bit confusing, because there is a stairway with seating on the second floor that you can only see the stairs or a dark curtain to the right on the ground floor, with the bar behind it and no signs to indicate where to check in for seating. We initially walked up stairs, and there were just people sitting and eating, so next we went back down stairs and walked through the curtain, and waited at the end of the bar where someone that looked like a server was behind a podium. From there on the night was great. If you're not easily confused , the food, service and ambience was great.

We weren't looking for anything super fancy, but we wanted a good meal, drinks and a laid-back environment. Slate ended up being a perfect fit for that, so we reserved a late dinner. 

We opted for their New Year's Eve prix-fixe menu which was a 6-course meal for $60 and a wine pairing for an additional $30. The first course was fish roe spread over bread, which was a nice start. For the second course I had duck egg rolls, which I didn't particularly like, but if I'm being honest, I shouldn't have picked that option since I don't even like egg rolls and I'm not a big fan of duck. I don't know what I was thinking. The third course was a rosemary lamb chop which was good, nothing special. Fourth came the risotto, which was rich in flavor and was only outdone by the next course, the filet mignon which was a perfect medium rare. The mashed potatoes that came along with it were a bit cold, but the filet was so good that I could only care so much. The 6th and final course was the buche de noel, which I had never tried before but loved. The wine pairings were perfect for each course, but they weren't always dropped off at the same time as the food so we spent some time waiting so we could have them together.

Self-described as affordable comfort food, I sampled their roasted acorn squash bisque with maple creme and toasted walnuts. I am a freak for good bisque and its texture and flavors were on the money, honey. So naturally I couldn't resist when I saw them during my pre-hurricane hibernation period. Polished interior, and the upstairs opens for weekends and events.

Noah was a fantastic bartender. He gave great food recommendations and chatted with our trio without being too invasive. A seasoned liver can be fairly happy here, even if you're not in the mood for wine. I cozied up to a Brooklyn black chocolate stout after waffling over the half dozen seasonal options.

Grilled vegetable sandwich was a bit lackluster, if only because of the generic soft white roll. Toast it with olive oil, I don't know. The grilled halloumi sandwiched in the boring carbs was dandy though, and I polished off the regular fries with some tasty aioli. Skinny and crispy is where it's at! Cajun chicken and chorizo pasta had just enough heat, and its cream sauce hit the right level of decadence while evenly coating the linguine and sliced red bell peppers. My hearty beef stew was most appropriate for a rainy day. All its elements were cooked to the right consistencies: still tender meat, light thickness on the broth, and the filler carrots/onion/potato cooked through. The toasted garlic bread wasn't shy on butter, but that didn't stop me from sopping up the stew. Southern rum cake wasn't overpoweringly sweet but I think the white chocolate drizzle was lessened after my questions pre-ordering.

This is my favorite bar in Glover Park now. Not sure I'd make it down for a wine class, but I'm intrigued to try a lot of their other menu items on days I'm not calorie-shy.

Like many, we had a LivingSocial coupon which persuaded us to go to the Glover Park area.  
While the wine list wasn't massive, it certainly had enough to keep you interested.
We had cocktails, which I agree with another reviewer,  were too expensive for the quality of the product, but still tasty.   

I ordered a 2011 Priorat, but when the bottle was brought to the table I noticed it was a 2012.  I had him pause before the cut the foil, and asked him to confirm that the wine list stated 2011.  He took the bottle away and went to the bar and I watched as he and the bartender both looked at the wine list.  2 minutes later he arrived with the 2011 bottle.  NO apology, just a presentation of the 2011 bottle for verification, and they seemed somewhat preturbed that I had actually noticed the incorrect Vintage of the bottle.   2 things could have happened.  1- They were running out of 2011 and bought a case of 2012 and simply grabbed a bottle fromt eh stacked bin and didn't verify the date.  OR 2-They intentionally were trying to give out 2012.  One would sincerely hope it was NOT the latter. 

We had the Tuna Poke and Blistered peppers for appetizers.  Both were very good.  For the entree we had the seared duck breast and the muscles.  Like another reviewer stated, additional crostini would have been nice for use with the broth.  There was definitely cream in the broth which gave it a very nice richness.  While the duck was ever so slightly cooked more than I prefer, it was still tender, juicy, and very flavorful.  For desert we decided on a cheese plate.  That seemed to throw off the waiter and staff as ""unusual""  LOL.  The cheese weren't outstanding but still better than average. The Majon was our favorite. 

Service was very good, but comical. The left hand apparently didn't know what the right hand was doing.   Each time a food item was delivered it was put in front of the incorrect person(they had a 50/50 shot).  The restaurant was not very busy but it wasn't a huge issue.  Our waiter dropped off a plate for the muscle shells before the entrees were served, and another server promptly took it away 2 minutes later, still before the entree was served.  We got a chuckle from that.  Our regular waiter stopped by, smiled, and said ""I'll get another plate for the shells""

If this place can nail down food consistency, I see no reason why this should become a permanent establishment in the area.  Good food, reasonable prices for the area, and good service as expected.

My one suggestion: if you're already selling grass fed beef, why not go all the way and sell hormone free, antibiotic free organic beef?

I didn't feel like an entree so I got a cup of French Onion Soup and one of the cheese plates. The soup was small but delicious and it came with the requisite provolone and baguette slice on top. I was expecting a very small cheese/sliced meat plate but the portions were very generous! The manchego and provolone were excellent, and average, respectively. The prosciutto was excellent--not fatty at all and just the right level of salty flavor. When I go back I'll definitely be ordering a larger plate with more options.

They also had ramps as a season specialty which my dining companion, although having lived in the DC area for a dozen years, had never tried ; she was impressive

The beef empanadas satisfied a long lasting urge for empanadas (guess who grew up in California). Patatas bravas, one of their premier dishes, were disappointing. Did not seem that different. On the other hand, get the Albondigas, meatballs with great sauce, satisfies both meat and spice craving, as does any of the sausage, especially Picante chorizo. I will definitely make it a regular. If you need a change, try La Piquette around the corner, another 5 from me!

We arrived at Ezme in time for our reservation. This is a middle eastern Tapas and wine bar. We started off with an eggplant spread and shared six other small plates amongst us. Half of us were vegetarians, so we tried items from the Gardens, Seas, and Lands. 

I personally found the vegetarian items lacking in flavors. The eggplant spread, one salad, the zucchini pancakes were fairly drab. The non veg items were better. The lamb kebab with plum was my favorite item. Other than those, the scallops and chicken breast kebabs were okay. 

We also tried a sauvignon blanc with our food. It was a good wine. One complaint is that the wine on the menu said it was a 2010 Bordeaux, but we were actually served a 2014.

Ezme's mid-upscale feel always leaves me full, delighted, and relaxed. Part of the reason I find it relaxing is that service is never rushed... so be prepared to take your time. 

Ordering mezzès (small plates) takes some time, some question-and-answer interaction with the waitstaff, and is best done with an open mind and adventurous palate. It's a great, fun way to expand your horizons, and have some grown-up fun with food. Suggestions made by the owner as well as the waitstaff -- from the menu as well as the wine list - have always been spot-on, and have coaxed some of my less adventurous meal companions to try something new - that they then end up wanting all for themselves. (Nope - gotta share.) I think it helps conversation flow, and that brings up another nice aspect of Esme's dining room -- it's never been too noisy. 

For my taste and preferred mealtime experience - I like to feel as though I'm on vacation - Ezme easily beats the other Turkish restaurants in the Dupont/downtown area, hands down. I also very much appreciate the Turkish wine flights, and the chef's commitment to bridging Turkish and other nearby cuisines with a modern, upscale feel, expertly cooked and attractively presented, without being fussy.

Service was pleasant. Our waitress was very kind and the food came out not all at once but as they were ready. It is tapas after all. So it was nice to enjoy one or two items at a time and not have the table overwhelmed with plates. I would like to mention the etiquette of the wine being served was on point.

An entire loaf of warm bread was served along with olive oil and a sweet balsamic. First we had the Samon Kanepe. Four pieces of smoked salmon served on a bruschetta with feta cheese (not cream cheese which was a nice Mediterranean twist) and an ezme and basil tomato sauce. The sauce definitely put the entire dish to a new level with it's great mild flavor. Karides Kebap which was basically seasoned grilled shrimp that were tasty but average. Kuzu Pirzola, two grilled pieced of rack of lamb that was nice and tender. My butter knife was able to slice through it. Delicately seasoned and drizzled with a port wine sauce (that tasted like a balsamic glaze) and came with dollops of mashed potatoes. I forgot the name of our last dish but it was either ground or chopped up beef shaped in a cylinder wrapped in thin eggplant.

Note the wine menu online is different than what they have in the restaurant. They offer a large selection of wine. I spent a lot of time perusing the wine menu (rather book) and decided on a bottle of Turkish wine that wasn't even listed in the menu but suggested by the server. I was hesitant to try Turkish wine but dining in a Turkish restaurant we just had to. And to my surprise I enjoyed it.

Very pleasant and enjoyable and would highly recommend Turkish wine if you like red wine on the drier side.

The restaurant had a bit of a sterile feel to it, not too much personality. The servers were nice and fast, but not very helpful when we had questions.  

Fortunately, most of the food was great.  We ordered four of the small plates, a side of Ottoman rice, and a meat lovers plate for two, and that was a really good amount of food for four very hungry people. Their recommendation that you get 4-5 small plates per person would have been ridiculous.

For small plates, we got the veggie kabob, a dip that was kind of like baba ganoush (can't remember the name or find it online), fried potatoes stuffed with beef, and the cheese-filled pastry cigars.

Knowing this, I should have taken the 35$ tasting menu, because you get the chance to try a little bit of everything.

Service has been phenomenal every time I've visited - the waitstaff is professional and friendly, especially the owner/manager.   Food can be hit or miss, though mostly hit.

Food, for the most part, is designed to be tapas.   So far, I've had the bread & hummus, somon kanape (lox bruschetta), chicken sandwich, mucver (zucchini pancake), and sigara boregi (a style of boureka).   The hummus is thick and rich, topped with olive oil and paprika (or maybe za'atar - I can't tell).  Bread is a thick, yet fluffy, sesame round, and goes quite well with the hummus.  To my tasty chicken sandwich, I added feta - it came with hummus, lettuce, and roasted red peppers.  But the salad, which comes as a side to the sandwich, was tossed in a gorgeous green vinaigrette (I'm thinking it was the basil one), and it was fresh and delicious.  

As for the appetizers, my favorite was the boureka.  I've yet to find a bad boureka, and the sigara boregi is a sort of a spring roll style, so the shell was really crisp.  I found the cheese and herb mixture a bit more interesting than cheese alone.  The mucver was not my favorite - I thought it would be crisp, more fritter-like, but it was maybe baked then lightly fried, and it was super oily, soft, and cold when I ate it - I would not order again.  Somon kanape was different - I might not suggest, but I might not veto either.   For me, I think it was something to do with the mixture of salmon and cheese - I rarely remember paring cheese with fish, and the combo does not even sound appealing to me, now that I think about it.

I enjoy Ezme, and hope to eventually get there for drinks, as they have a nice wine list, and a sign above the bar stating ""Wine:  How classy people get wasted"".  I couldn't agree more.

Some of the best service I've ever experienced in DC, from both waitress and maitre'd. Showed up on a Friday night with a party of four without reservations, and they were able to accommodate us despite being completely booked. 

Although a small space, they've livened it up since itsdays as Pesce. The upholstered chairs are comfy and the wine bottles along the exposed brick side wall really give it a different appearance, as do the Turkish tile work and plates on the walls. 

The meze here are probably the best I've had at a Turkish restaurant in the DC area. I had the chef's tasting menu (with wine pairings), so was able to get an idea of the breadth of their cooking. The muhammara (roasted red pepper paste with walnuts, olive oil, lemon juice and garlic) doesn't have the pomegranate molasses that you'll find in some Syrian or Lebanese restaurants, but was good just the same. The cerkez tavugu (shredded chicken with walnuts, garlic and paprika) was nothing short of a revelation; I challenge you to find a tastier chicken salad out there. The tasting menu also comes with a small portion of donner kebab, but my favorite was the Adana kebab that one of my dining companions had: a perfectly seasoned mixture of ground lamb and beef beautifully presented. 

Our server was nothing short of fantastic. She was friendly yet professional, without being too distant or overbearing. She let us sample several wines before choosing a bottle (for the others at the table). Their wine list was quite reasonably priced and included several Turkish choices.

It looks like they've changed the dinner menu pricing a bit since we went, which helped me decide which side of the fence to fall on.  I'm not sure why I let Hyunoo drag us away from our spot in line at Pizzeria Paradiso when we were as hungry/drunk as we were from Tuberculosis's birthday shindig down the street at One Lounge.  Okay, fine, when I was as hungry/drunk as I was.  We were seated fairly quickly near the entrance by a friendly server who was convinced that Sonja must be Turkish.  Cozy space and a relatively older crowd at the time, but the four of us were in a world of merriment on our own.

The presentation of my manti was lovely at tableside, like delicious little beef dumplings in a creamy, tangy yogurt sauce.  The buttered red pepper sauce added a nice warmth to the dish's flavor profile.  The scallops in WD's deniz taragi were cooked well, even if sized for a tea party.  Hyunoo's tavuk kofte, lovingly nicknamed by hungry chus as ""chicken nuggets,"" took about 30 minutes longer than the rest of our dishes, and came out piping hot with just enough to share tastes of.  The accompanying potatoes made for a good flavor balance, but the chicken meatballs were also fine on their own.  Pretty satisfied with our protein choices, and mildly ambivalent about the mucver.  Sonja was happier with the wine than Hyunoo, but that's a whole other argument waiting to happen.

I'm definitely intrigued enough to come back to try other menu items eventually, both familiar (dolma & babaganush in particular) and not, but tapas portioning joints just aren't a place I'd become a regular at.

-Sebza Kebabs were also very good: not heavy or overdone,  veggies were fresh, and the hummus they came with was a perfect complement. 

We had the trio of sorbets for dessert and each got a glass of wine, with the bill coming in under $30/person including tip. It was definitely the right amount of food; I left feeling satisfied but not overstuffed. They were extremely nice, the food was good, they had a decent selection of wines (though given their selection they should lower some of their prices a bit), and a lot of vegetarian options. I will definitely go back.

We were the second set of people to come in here, actually we could have been the first but I wasn't aware that they opened at 5:30. We got there around 5:00.

Parking is a little bit of a mess around here so have wishful thinking. 

I wasn't one hundred percent sure about what I wanted cause I REALLY wanted a BURGER. My rant is over. But when we ordered the food came out pronto, very hot and tasty. We received our tomato mozzarella salad first. It was very good and they had a sauce on it that enhanced its dish. The bread with the olive oil was okay. I seasoned it with salt and pepper to add more flavor. 

I got chicken kabob and he got a dish with two meats and rice. I do not remember the name of his dish. But he seemed to enjoy it. My kabob was really difficult to remove and as a result it when flying. Not too far though. They replaced my kabob without me asking. 

Overall, this is a very nice atmosphere, attentive, and with polite staff. I do agree with other reviewers who feel that their portions are small or lacking for the price. When my kabob came out I really thought to myself, ""no rice?"" But to be fair, I came out satisfied.

The selection of three spreads to accompany the bread is a must. In fact you could just sit at the bar, order wine and enjoy these little bowls of tasty morsels.

When we got in we checked out the regular menu and realized we could get about 3X the amount of food for the same amount compared to the 3 course $35/person restaurant week menu. Everything there was ""tapas"" style, meaning it is served in the traditional Turkish way--little plates of food to be shared around the table. Each plate had enough for 4-5 to comfortably taste each item (unless you are really hungry or really like the particular dish then it's probably good for 2-3 people). The waitress was pretty efficient at refilling our glasses and removing plates. One thing I really liked about this restaurant was that if a waiter walked by and saw an empty plate he removed it...instead of leaving to pile up (especially important at a tapas style eatery since the dishes tend to pile up). Much appreciated.

I did knock down a star just because the doner kebap was so horrendous; they didn't have any manti that night (I was REALLY looking forward to trying this); the food came out one dish at a time; they didn't offer anything for us to start off with (bread) and so we waited with just water until the first dish came out and everyone watched our friend eat his appetizer of choice.

Ezme is a tapas place, primarily, so for Restaurant Week they upped some of the dishes to entree size and created a few specials. They have an extensive wine list, to include several Turkish wines and several flights. They also note nut, dairy, and gluten-free dishes on the menu, which was awesome for my friend who has some pretty hefty nut allergies and isn't familiar with Turkish food.

For appetizers, friend had the grilled shrimp and I had the stuffed potato shells (not even gonna try to remember turkish names for things.... sorry Semra!).  Hers came with two skewers of shrimp, perfectly grilled, and their take on a creamy cocktail sauce. Mine was two small potato shells, stuffed with lamb, beef, and walnuts, lightly battered and fried. YUM. Both of them. For entrees, I had the traditional lamb dish with mashed potatoes and tomato.  I was a little bummed, because it was only two smallish pieces of lamb - it didn't look entree sized. I felt a little cheated. But it was GOOD, and it filled me up more than I thought it would. Friend had what I'm going to call the meat deluxe - basically, a sampling of just about every kind of meat they serve. She took a big portion of it home, only partially because she'd had a snack earlier in the afternoon. For dessert, friend had the profiterol and I had the pistachio and cream filled filo pastry. Hers was pretty standard, although the ganache on top was very yum. Mine was REALLY good, and even though it was a lot more pistachio than I thought it was going to be, I was surprised to find out that it turns out I like pistachios in dessert :) I also had the Turkish Red Wine flight, and it was quite tasty.

Service the entire time was excellent, although the entrees came out before we were done with the appetizers, which is always a pet peeve. Other than that, though, our server was just attentive enough, and very friendly. 

Overall, I REALLY liked Ezme - the ambiance, the size, the fact that its a quiet little corner in the not always quiet Dupont Circle. I also really liked the regular menu, and I'm kind of excited to go back not during Restaurant Week.

The food and service are great, and the atmosphere is nice as well, but the tables are spaced together a little too closely (another guest was really close to my chair).  I visited for dinner and ordered a three-course meal for $35, which included:

-Appetizer: Tarte a l'oignon (Onion tart with bacon and baby green salad).  This was quite delicious.  They also had escargot as an appetizer and I even tried an escargot that my foodie dining companion ordered too.  That was my first time trying escargot.  I wasn't willing to get the whole dish myself, but it was nice to have a tasting of it.
-Entree: Paillason de Saumon (salmon in potato crust, roasted shiitake, vermouth white corn sauce).  This was very unique.  Can't say it's my favorite dish ever, but it was definitely interesting to eat salmon baked in a potato crust!
-Dessert: Tarte au fruit du jour (homemade fruit tart of the day).  This was delicious, too!

Wine List - I was impressed with the extensive list of wine FROM France. I know this is a French restaurant so you would expect French wine but the selection was wonderful. I've been to Paris and my best friend who was with us lived in France for a year so we were ecstatic. So much that we ordered 3 bottles. For the group.

We were served waters and wine and they placed a thick slice of warm crunchy baguette in front of each of us. The butter was standards, individually wrapped at refrigerator temperature. I do wish they had the butter out at room temperature. What I appreciate, since we were downing wine and all, they came by several times with the bread basket and asked if we wanted more throughout dinner. I love bread. And I love wine.

I ordered the soup of the day to start. Gosh I couldn't even tell you what it was but I know it had clams in it. However, even with the abundance of chopped clam throughout the entire soup it did not taste fishy or oceany at all. It was delicious and I ate every last drop. I was torn between the salmon but decided on the Medaillons de boeuf poelles (beef medallions with gruyere polenta and wild mushroom rosemary jus). The beef was so tender and moist and cooked perfectly (medium rare). It sliced beautifully and didn't have a single struggle with it being chewy. I was absolutely impressed with the portion. I was serve three well sized medallions. I have a bias opinion that French portions are tiny and leave you hungry (because I'm American and everything is bigger in...) but three medallions left me with a food baby. I could definitely see them serving just one but three was generous and greatly appreciated. The gruyere polenta was the perfect balance of carbohydrate that didn't leave me feeling heavy.

It is located in a very discreet building in the less-glamorous part of G'town Wisconsin avenue. We were greeted by a lovely host and sat in a table at the back of the restaurant. It is a very small restautant (c.15 tables downstairs, a bar upstairs and what seems to be a private dinning area), but it does not feel crowded. 

I tried the Gazpacho (as a native of Spain I felt it was a bit tasteless, but nonetheless good), the bread was good, and so was the Risotto with stuffed Quail (too much Quail and not enough risotto), and the apricot tart. 

Service is mostly discreet and efficient. We stayed for over 90' after finishing our meal talking and no-one bother us to pay and leave. Bravo!

The temperature of the restaurant is excellent (not one of those places where during the summer you freeze while eating because of the AC), and the restrooms were OK.

If everything was so good then why 4 starts and not 5? Because of the usual overprices you pay all over Georgetown.

We chose the comfy seating upstairs. Our waiter was awesome - had a perfect French accent (but appeared to be American!), conveyed the deals of the day to us (wine tastings are complimentary on Tuesday, and the wine we tasted was 50% off). 

The variety of food that we ordered was interesting and delicately balanced. I ordered mussels for my appetizer, the house salad for my main meal, and the chocolate mousse for dessert. I was surprised that the mussels were dry when they arrived. Not exactly what I was expecting, but they still tasted good and were accompanied by unique spices, which is always a plus for me. The salad was not as special as the waiter made it out to be, so I stole a bite of my bf's duck confit, which was very tasty. I finished the meal with the chocolate mousse, which was amazing! I didn't think I would be able to squeeze dessert in, but this was so good I had to. The wine we had went very well with the meal.

After experiencing three sub-par to ok restaurants in Baltimore, I was worried that my standards were a bit too high, but Bistrot Lepic reaffirmed my love for restaurant week!

We did the lunch menu for 5 and everyone was happy with what they got. The bf and I split the following:
1. Escargot: so tender and delicious, and the garlic butter sauce was AMAZING. Perfect with the crusty French bread!
2. Pate: awesome flavor and everything I love about pate. Came with cornichons and olives, and only one little crostini. Luckily there was that French bread!!
3. Beef medallions: perfectly medium-rare. Wonderful savory sauce with yummy vegetables! I didn't taste much gruyere in the polenta, but it was yummy nonetheless.
4. Calf liver: my favorite!!! I love liver and this was an absolutely fantastic dish. The liver was seared well but tender and soft inside. The sauce had yummy baby vegetables, capers, olives, and grapes. I particularly loved the saltiness of the capers/olives contrasted with the sweetness of the grapes.
5. Ile flottante: we were very intrigued by how the egg whites would taste. It was somewhat like a meringue, very light and fluffy, floating in a delicious cream sauce. The egg whites were also toasted (we speculated with a blow torch), giving it a nice color.
6. Crème glacee au chocolat blanc: a delicious mousse like cream which was surprisingly with a very distinct white chocolate flavor! 

All in all the food was awesome and I would totally come back!

A few other notes:
1. Loved the decor, it's tight (my friend accidentally got hit in the head as a waiter squeezed by....) but home-y. Upstairs is the wine bar which is also very cute and would be fun to hang out in.
2. Service was ok: our waiter was a little douchey, but warmed up a bit towards the end. He also accidentally charged us for dessert separately and we had to point out that it was supposed to be included in the Restaurant Week pricing. Perhaps it was just a bad day or because of the hectic nature of restaurant week.

We happened to walk in with no reservations and we were greeted and seated without a problem.

The menu offered several options and yummy selections to choose from.  I spied and checked out all the food that was being served on the next table.  The mushroom omelet looked so delicious and perfectly done.  The escargot permeated the room with the divine garlicky butter sauce!

I started with a flute of champagne which I enjoyed.

Our waiter was very nice and offered both of us a mixed baby green salad since he predicted that there was going to be a little wait for our entrees.  Great service and attention to detail.

1.  Oeufs à la truffe noire en cocotte A Cocotte of poached eggs in truffle butter and homemade mashed potato.
Decadent and delicious!  I did not expect it to be this yummy!  The eggs were  served and layered in a glass jar.  The eggs were poached to perfection sitting on top of the decadent Robuchon like mash potatoes with the double divine decadence of truffle butter.  Heavenly!  It comes with a baguette that you can use to dip and swirl around to get every bit of yummiest!

2.  Le paillasson de saumon aux raisins Salmon in potato crust, fresh grapes and  Ouzo sauce.
Hubby ordered this and was very happy.  The salmon was moist and cooked to perfection encased in the potato crust which was nice and golden brown and just the perfect amount.  The ouzo sauce added another dimension without overpowering the fish.  Delicious!!,

Their goat cheese salad, and salads in general were, though, of low quality in my opinion.  The greens weren't all that crisp.

He couldn't stop talking about it after we left the restaurant.  Everything they make with mushrooms is fabulous, and the lemon risotto was amazing. Although you don't think ""curry!"" when you plan to eat at a French restaurant, my husband thoroughly enjoyed the chicken curry.

The wine selection is nice; lots of choices, but not so many that you are completely overwhelmed.  Very short list for by-the-glass wine, but that's OK.  They have nice hot tea.

Our wait staff was very pleasant, helpful, and attentive. From our conversation with her, it sounds like she has been working there for many years. 

Ok, on to the food. First of all, do not let the prices on the menu scare you off. Yes, they are a bit on the high side, but totally worth it. Read on....

We started off with the bread basked, which had muffins, challah bread, and two croissants' (regular, and chocolate filled). The bread came with preserves and butter. So good. Just so very very good. Treat yourself to these carbs. You deserve it.

For our lunch entree's, my wife had the free range organic chicken with curry, coconut milk, lemongrass and saffron Basmati rice. Just stunning! The chicken was superb, and the curry was very flavorful with just the right amount of heat. A very balanced and tasty dish.

I enjoyed the beef medaillons with gruyere polenta and wild mushroom rosemary jus. Words fail how savory and delicious this dish was. But, suffice to say that I had my way, I would go back the very next day and order this without hesitation. The beef was tender, perfectly seasoned, and cooked to a nice medium doneness. The mushrooms and rosemary complement each other nicely in the au jus. A happy bonus was the cheese infused polenta - heavier than mashed potatoes, but not too heavy. I am not a polenta expert, but they were delicious. 

For desert we enjoyed a compote (sorry - do not recall the exact name) which was comprised of fresh whipped cream on top, a layer of caramel underneath, and light and aromatic tropical fruit at the bottom.

It was great to see a real mix of clientele from the younger set at the Wine Bar to old-time regulars in the main dining area showing it's widespread appeal.

Parking was easy as we found a spot quickly just down the street (how often can you say that in DC??).  As we were early, my wife and I went upstairs to the Wine Bar.   We liked the intimate feel of the space, though the decor a mix of asian and french styles a bit odd.  Several wines by the glass were available, and the bartender gave us a couple of tastes as we decided on our choice.  We were both given good pours, but found the price per glass a bit high (they do offer 1/2 glass pours).   All in all, a nice setup to the evening.

We joined our friends in the main dining room.  A bright, cheery space with a more defined French atmosphere.  We were lucky enough to have come during 'French Restaurant Week' which many French restaurants put on to celebrate Bastille Day.  Bistrot Lepic was offering three courses for $35.00, a great deal, and to their credit every course had several options.

The menu is solid 'countryside' food representing Southern France beginning with the freshly baked baguettes that were delivered hot from the oven as we sat down. Highlights for the first course were the beet & goat cheese terrine and the pate.   Main courses were equally good.  We ordered a range including the Médaillons de boeuf, Le cassoulet & grilled rainbow trout.  All were cooked well and had classic flavors that you would expect.

Another poster commented that the service was good, not ""overly friendly"" -- a bit 'no nonsense, but in a good way.'  Have to say I agree with that that.  What I liked was that we never felt rushed, even when were were so caught up chatting that our server had to return to take our order.

Deserts were equally good.  The chocolate tart came hot and had a great topping and a light fluffy inside.  The berry tart and creme brulee disappeared pretty quickly!  At that point my only disappointment was that I was too full to finish my desert!

We decided to head back up to the wine bar to finish the evening and had one last surprise.  Out of curiosity I asked about the beer selection and they had several good European choices including a Belgium Chimay which was served in the appropriate glass.

My companion ordered the cassoulet which was absolutely delectable.  I've never had it before and I was slightly jealous that I didn't order it myself.  I had the lamb medallions.

Let me first tell you that I visited Bistro Lepic and Wine Bar during Restaurant Week Summer 2010 with a group of friends who commonly dine together at 5-star places and genuinely appreciate quality meals, particularly of the European/Mediterranean genre.  We all raved about the food, which was excellent at restaurant week prices.  The wine selection was great and the desserts were divine.  The ambiance was also good, with two floors - bottom strictly for dining - top for munching and wining.  I had a gazpacho and then a seafood salad, both of which were excellent, but the best appetizer at the table was the lemon risotto.  The best entree was the lamb cheeks.  Divinity in gastronomy.

The reason the restaurant got a 4 from me and not a 5 is because of service.  What would a fine French bistro be without a fine French owner serving your table?  While we eventually made friends, his initial reaction was what you would expect from a Parisian restauranteur - brusque, unfriendly, and even slightly rude.  Personally, I am a fan of servers who are polite, friendly, make eye contact, and don't tell you ""I can't choose for you, sorry,"" when you ask for recommendations.  Is that too much to ask?

The Wine Room is on the second floor, and has a lounge-ey feel. There are a bunch of chairs and tables to enjoy wine by the glass or champagne. Or maybe a martini or cocktail. For cocktails I recommend the Bistrot Le Pig-- a mix of rum, triple sec, and two juices. Fruity!

Order a bunch of ""Appeteasers"" which are basically tapas done French style like the onion tart, smoked trout salad and/ or the tuna carpaccio. Oh, and if you are a cheese fan you will like the cheese menu here. You can make your own cheese plate for 12 bucks (3 cheeses) or 18 bucks (5 cheeses). Either way you get grapes, bread, apples and sweet butter with it.

Three experiences that sum this place up: 

1) Reserved the private room upstairs to co-host dinner for an ambassador. The service over the 3-hour dinner was impeccable - attentive without interrupting, timely and professional. Prices were reasonable, the food was great, the wine well paired. I'd happily throw an event here again. 

2) I was trying to close a contract with potential clients who'd been doing the film festival circuit and were not loving DC. I met them at the upstairs wine bar w/ two of my colleagues. One excellent cheese plate (all French, some good goat selections), a couple small dishes, and two good bottles of wine later and we'd sealed the deal. The atmosphere at Lepic was convivial and warm, conversational without being too noisy. The small plates featured on the menu are a tasty substitute for a heavy meal. Parfait!

I would have loved anything I ordered. I eventually flipped a coin to just get an order in. I had one of the specials: Opah, a hawaiian fish, that was seared, placed on a bed of arugula and polenta and topped with a fancy yellow mustardy-wine-herb sauce. If you had told me the opah was fatty tuna, I honestly wouldn't have known the difference. It was top quality fish and cooked perfectly, so I savored every bite. Slowly. My only complaint is that the serving size is too small. I was still hungry after dinner - even with a glass of wine. My date got the cassoulet, which tasted to me like every other cassoulet I've ever had, perhaps less mushy. But it filled him up. 

We were seated upstairs for dinner in the room behind the wine bar area, where it feels more private. The tables near us emptied halfway into the meal, which gave us even more privacy. 

I have to comment on the decor because of its eclectic mix.  I couldn't tell you what the general style is. But, for what it's worth, I like it. Deep orange walls, simple red poppy paintings with white background, colorful large blown glass things, thick antique mirrors and tropical-looking wicker-ish furniture.  It's all over the place, but it works.

We were seated immediately at a small table (our candle was out so my boyfriend switched it with another table's).  I am not sure if reservations were absolutely required on a weeknight like this.
We waited a VERY long time for a waiter to bring us water and wine.  Even longer for bread.  I know the French trend is to eat slowly, but the wait at the very beginning was tough.  The wine was good (I got Chardonnay and I am not picky, but it was much better than my normal bar/happy hour glass).  The bread was amazing (we had more later even though we were full haha)
For appetizers I had the lobster bisque which was pretty basic.  Good but not anything spectacular.  My boyfriend had the salmon tartar which he said was good.  For dinner, i had veal cheeks with pasta.  Everything was cooked wonderfully, the cheeks were just something completely new to me so I have nothing to compare it to.  My boyfriend had a dish with duck and lamb, I forget the name but it was very good.
For dessert, I obviously had the creme brulee.  It was a big portion and I liked it a lot, but it could have been a tad warmer.  My boyfriend had the chocolate tart from the dessert display, which was very rich and was pretty much like thick chocolate cake.

The food:

Bread: Great, of course!

Foie gras: It was on the menu that night, so we had to go for it. Perfectly seared, melting out a good bit of the fat and making the whole thing into a big oily meat-sponge. Mmmmmm. Nice vinegar reduction and some sauteed apples were a great compliment.

Escargots: Butter and basil and lots of it. Perfectly prepared and tender as can be.

Veal kidneys: I felt like I hadn't gotten my quota of offal lately so we gave them a shot. I remembered kidneys being my favorite of the turkey-gravy organs growing up, so I went for it. Great texture, well-cleaned. Nice snap to them, no fat or chewy bits or anything. Great mustard sauce. Only a little bit of porta-potty taste at the end, which is par for the course with kidneys.

Veal cheeks: Braised to perfection in a nice brown sauce, ringing a mound of pasta in cream in the center of the plate. Melts in your mouth.  

All in all, a great experience. This is one of those places that is old and reliable - it's not getting any hype any more because it's not the hot new thing, but I'll bet it's as dependable as the sun rising.
