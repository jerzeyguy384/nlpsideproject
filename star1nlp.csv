70,ENO Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=2qH3A7LkhNRGD4hzFnJ0IQ,"Visited a while back and found this un-posted review in my drafts today: 

I've never been much of a yelp reviewer but my experience at Eno this evening (7/18/14) was so dreadful I felt I needed to post here. I came in around 9:30 after a dinner on the waterfront with a few friends all of us in our early twenties, we live in Georgetown and have been meaning to try this place for a while. We intended to order three or four bottles and enjoy a long night but the staff at Eno had other ideas. 

At first we walked in asking if we could sit outside, they pointed us, aggravated at our asking, towards the back door which, when we exited the restaurant, opened back up towards the street and one or two small two persons tables... Obviously not a fit for our group of six--clearly just from us walking in they already wanted to get us out. We then asked next to sit upstairs, it was as if we had asked to be seated at a table suspended above the restaurant on a flying carpet! The staff acted as thought our request could not have been more bothersome. When we were finally seated we began to talk at the table and, god forbid someone told a joke and we all laughed, almost immediately two waiters walked by our table eyeing us and asking condescendingly if we did in fact intend to order something, bear in mind we have been seated for less than three minutes and do not yet even have menus. I, being the only one in the group with a bit of wine knowledge, was attempting to explain the differences between different vintages and what not to the others and apparently I was doing a bad job because the waiter came up and cut me off and began to almost make fun of me and us as we attempted to figure out what we wanted to order. Eventually we did order a few glasses of wine, drank them and left having quite the sour taste for ENO.

I then asked for wine suggestions and he asked some basic questions about price and varietals then  walked away without telling us what he was going to get us. We had to call him back, only to find that the wine he unilaterally picked was not what we wanted nor was it within the price range we had given.  

We also ordered a ludicrously over priced pot of fondue, or should I say cup.  The taste and texture wasn't right and they gave us 3 tiny little pickles, a pittance of bread, and no little onions.  Just a total rip off.

I can't recommend this place the wait staff was terrible and the food didn't meet expectations.  The wine was fine, but not what I would expect from a place that labels itself as a wine bar.

We really wanted to like this place but - and I am not being overly dramatic - we were snubbed by the waiter for 15 minutes upon sitting down. 15 minutes is a very, very long time for a waiter to walk by no less than 7 times on his way to other tables and his only words to us were, ""It's going to be a few minutes."" 

Not cool, man. I've been a server and even if you're in the weeds, you at least greet the table and drop water and menus. 

Once he found the time to take our order, we ordered only three items: two glasses of wine and one bowl of olives. The wine took five minutes to make its way from downstairs to upstairs. From our table we had a view of the bar below and the kitchen window. We watched our olives sit. And sit. And sit. And sit. 

We had reservations at Bourbon next door. We had to leave. The waiter altogether disappeared, so we left cash on the table for our glasses of wine and bolted. 

This place looks cool and has potential but management needs to fire their current wait staff and hire new servers who can take lessons from The Four Seasons on how to serve your customers well.

However, my visit on Thursday night week will be my last.  After having to ask three different people for our check, we finally got it and noticed it was wrong and we were charged for an extra glass of wine.  I notified our male server and asked for an updated check.  He looked annoyed but came back with a new check.  We paid and as we were getting ready to walk out the door, the male server approached us again and said that he KNOWS the original check was correct.  I was taken aback at first assuming this was a joke and that our underwhelming server was not confronting our group in front of everyone, but I was in fact wrong. He was. He continued to argue with me and eventually walked off.  I must say this is the first time in my life I have been confronted by a server over a glass of wine.

Twenty mins pass and we get another server...with still none of our drinks present or the starter/complimentary bread that every table seemed to have. The second server asks if we were ready to order..we told him that we were waiting on a marked menu but by that time we just wanted to leave...the second server finally puts  the order in and one dish that we ordered initially with our drinks, comes out...still none of our drinks in sight. The second and third dish come out  15 mins later...then finally our drinks (40 mins later from initial order time)  then our other dishes come  but the calamari we ordered still was missing (we ordered 2!) then the server who dropped the food (mind you 3rd server now) says oh I didn't see there was calamari ordered--at that point we just wanted one order...we were ready to go (hungry and all) ohh and finally the bread mets our table. The food was decent but the service really really tainted the experience we were hoping to get. THEN......we get the check and the server puts 3 calamari orders on our check. We explained it to her and she removed it and apologized....it was a DISASTER. I wish we could of had a better review/experience :(

Service:
Ok so outside their service is interesting. They have multiple waiters serving the same tables so you don't necessarily have one waiter...With that being said, I waited over 20 minutes to be greeted by a waiter at my table after bing seated. I would have been overlooked again if it wasn't for a busboy walking by that I grabbed. This made me FURIOUS. After I grabbed him, the manager (Steve) came over and was extremely sweet and took my order. 

About an hour & half later, we needed refills on drinks, we waited about 20 minutes again for that. I grabbed a random waiter and asked if she knew who our waiter was and she said ""oh yeah thats me""...""are you ok""...""what do you need"".....(Tiffany)

Again, I was furious that she knew she purposely kept walking past our table! A few minutes later, we met another lady who literally began waiting on our table 3/4ths of the way done. She came in from a shift change so she literally didn't know what was going on. She was so sweet (Anna) 

Needless to say, we got the tab and had no idea who our waiter was because the manager and Anna picked up the slack for Tiffany. She got lucky....but she was by far the worst waiter I have ever come across

Food: 
The food was blahhhh....full of grease and butter. There was not one item that I really enjoyed over the others. I ordered about 7 different plates and nothing tasted good....NOTHING! 

Overall, I wouldn't recommend anyone going here unless you only care about the atmosphere and ambiance. If you want to eat something worth paying these prices for...go else ware. I wasted over 2 hours of my life in this place...

I asked another bartender and he produced one.  I ordered the drink I like and having ordered it at other Barcelona know it takes more than 10 seconds to make, this bartender handed me the drink, which was 3/4 full in 1 second. I asked him what was up with the drink and said I know you can't make it that fast. He said he had it behind the bar. Not only that, it was only ¾ full. I am a 50 year old woman, not some kid, that kind of service is unacceptable, additionally who knows what was in the drink if it had been sitting around!  When I asked to settle the bill, I handed him a $20 for an $11 drink, either he tried to pull a fast one or didn't know the price of the drink or what, but he handed me $8 in change.

Instead, my friend (who booked the reservation - which was confirmed by the restaurant, lest we forget) ended up on the receiving end of an overly defensive and honestly, rude, lecture from the GM about how they were ""doing us a favor"" by taking our reservation (again, this never came up when we booked the reservation, or when we called a week ago to up the number of people, or when they called to confirm the day of) and to tell us that we shouldn't have left after an hour of waiting since they were ""about to seat us anyways."" There was also a snide comment about seeing Yelp reviews posted by members of our party, as if we were somehow inaccurately retelling the events. Unbelievable. 

In summary:

1) Next time you want to ""do us a favor"" - don't call your customers back the next day to insist you were right in accepting and confirming our reservation and then letting us wait for over an hour.

I understand these things happen - especially at a trendy restaurant in a very popular neighborhood (I do live here, after all) -  but don't call and try to bully people for expecting service - ""favor"" or no.

2) I've never, in any restaurant, in any city - ever - fine dining or otherwise (not that this is necessarily ""fine"" dining), heard of a restaurant calling customers the next day to defend their failure to deliver on their promise.

Our waiter explained that the cooks had messed up my order and will be out very soon. By then my first order of potatoes were extremely cold. I wanted to eat my potatoes with the steak tapa option but it never came. 

Finally 40 minuets after receiving my first Tapa (the potatoes) the steak came out but the empanadas I ordered were still missing. At this point the waiter was flustered and I simply asked him to cancel my order of empanadas. My fiancee had also ordered empanadas but was no longer in the mood to eat because of such a long wait. We told our waiter to cancel his order as well and just bring he and I two orders of crepes. 

My order of crepes then came out 15 minutes later;however my fiancee's did not. Then after about 10 minutes we reminded the waiter about canceling my fiancee's order of empanadas and bringing out the crepes instead. Our waiter said okay ill go put that into the system. Implying he had not done that before. Needless to say we waited another 20 mintues for the crepes. At this point I had already finished eating my crepes and my Fiancee was just starting to eat. 

Then the waiter continued to state that this was not his fault it was the cooks but even then everyone in a restaurant is part of a team and should not blame the other. Our waiter also kept asking ""are you in a rush or something, you should have told me from the beginning"". We found this rude, we were not in a rush;however we were hungry.

We left the restaurant, without having ever been seated inside, and without ever having been given a chance to EAT DINNER. The manager comped our drinks and the appetizers.

I went to this establishment Saturday night around 8:00 PM, and let me tell you this place was packed.  It obviously had a wait just from the look of things.  So me and my friend made our way to the front host stand.  There was a line out the door, so it took us a few minutes to make our way up to the front of the line, but when we finally got there, we all of a sudden became invisible.  The host who had no issues helping other customers up to that point, but all of a sudden was writing on his clip board, looking around, walking off etc.  I guess he was just trying to get situated with the volume of people that were there.  That I understand.  They are a new establishment, and they are probably working out kinks, they don't have their ""groove"" down yet.  

We stood their I would say maybe a minute before some other person said they would be right with us.  Maybe 5 minutes later the original host came back and continued to look at his clip board and do what he was doing.  In the meantime, another couple came up beside us.  I guess they didn't realize that we were in line waiting.  The host decided that was a good time to start greeting people again.  He immediately asked the couple how he could help them, meanwhile I'm pushing 6 minutes with not even a hello or glance in our direction.  They let the host know that we were actually first so he asked us how he could help us.  We put our name on the list, but decided we were going to go somewhere else and spend our money.  We ended up going to a smaller, less packed wine bar down the street and had a lovely time.

It bothers me to my core when I get different service than the person next to for superficial reasons.  I work entirely to hard and come on, ain'tnobodygottimeforthat!

Bottom line- I didn't get a chance to try this place, and I'm not saying I will never go there for one reason or another; nor am I making any sort of blanket statement about the establishment as a whole.

After reading Yelp reviews for years, Barcelona has finally convinced me to write a review.  How this place has 4  1/2 stars on yelp is beyond my comprehension. 

My friend and I were excited to try Barcelona for dinner, after having had an excellent time at the bar a few weeks before. We ordered a bottle of wine, Serrano ham and manchego cheese, Brussels sprouts, and the Barcelona mix grill (a selection of steak, pork, chicken, and sausage. 

The meat and cheese arrived far before our bottle of wine... OK fine we think, not the end of the world. The wine arrived and everything went downhill. Our plates were cleared when the mixed grill arrived, and we remained without plates or steak knives for several minutes, while I tried to get the attention of either of our waiters. Once we were finally provided with plates and steak knives, the pork on the mixed grill was cut, only to find that it was extremely pink and still cold in the center-- completely unacceptable. 

 It took 10 more minutes to find our waiter; in order to have the pork cooked more-- not an unreasonable request. However, I was treated by the waiter with extreme disdain. I asked, very politely, if the pork could be cooked a bit more, and I was met with an exaggerated sigh and eye rolling. He then told me to wait a minute, before coming back a few minutes later to retrieve the pork which was on my plate. I then sat without a plate until the pork was recooked, returned to our table, and then for several more minutes until I was able to track down a waiter. During this whole time, approximately 30 minutes, not once did either waiter stop by our table to ask how everything was, or to refill water glasses, or to refill wine glasses, or to bring a plate. That's right, I didn't have a plate for a half hour. I would review the mixed grill, but honestly I don't really remember anything about it other than the undercooked pork. 

Finally once I received a plate, we inquired with our waiter about the Brussels sprouts, 40 minutes after receiving our mixed grill. After inquiring about the Brussels sprouts, they still took another 10 minutes to arrive. Once they did arrive, they were awful, with some overcooked, but the majority undercooked and still very hard. Moreover, the Brussels sprouts were incredibly salty. 

The only thing that arrived quickly was the bill, which after all of the mishaps still contained the Brussels sprouts on the bill. At that point, I tracked down on of the managers, Jamie, who quickly removed the Brussels sprouts from our bill-- the only small bright spot of the night. I would have laid out the full list of my complaints in while at the restaurant, but I was so fed up with the awful service, that I wanted out of the restaurant as soon as possible.

But, I too had an experience very similar to Andrea W's at this establishment that I felt that I needed to speak up.  In fact, my experience with hers was so similar, I had to do a double take when I read it. 

We live around the neighborhood, and have been walking by the restaurant as it was preparing to open.  We were excited to try it once it opened up because it had a cool open and outdoor plan.  

We came by around 6:30 on Saturday.  Even at this time, there was a line out the door.  The people in front of us (who all happened to be white) checked in, and they decided to stop checking people in when it was our turn.  It was busy, so we didn't think anything of it.  We got to the front, there was a woman greeter and a male manager.  Neither of them acknowledged me, but again, it was busy so that was OK.  I know they saw me as they looked up at me a few times.  The manager was checking his clipboards and taking care of other things.  I still waited right in front of him.  Then a group of three young white girls comes into the door area to wait and then apparently the manager saw them right away as if he had selective eyesight of some sort, and greeted them first.  I told the woman greeter that I was waiting before them.  She just shrugged and looked toward the guy.  After he seated the group of three girls right away, he finally came to acknowledge me.  I told him I was before them and that we are a party of two. He said there were a couple of parties before me (OK, but those girls came in and were seated right away).  I asked him how long the wait would be... answer was a shrug of the shoulders.  OK...  Finally, I asked for an outside table.  Again, needed to wait as there were a few parties in front of me.  I understand that its busy, but I asked a few very basic questions that all people waiting for a table would be interested in.  If you don't have an estimate, say, ""its hard to say, probably an hour...""  Don't just completely ignore questions altogether. 

At this point, I was put off and decided to leave.  My hard earned money does not need to be wasted on this kind of experience.  And you don't go out to get aggravated.  But I was aggravated, so I decided to get more information on why that exchange had just occurred.  I went back to the stand and asked him why he didn't acknowledge me first and why the later party was acknowledged and seated before us.  He gave me some general answer about how its busy, how its hard to tell who came in first, and that group of girls wanted an inside table.  Nevermind, that even before I brought up the fact that I wanted an outside table, he had told me that I would have to wait anyway.  It wasn't worth aggravation to argue at this point, so we just left. 

If you don't look a certain way, then save your aggravation and your money and go elsewhere.

Our utensils were heavily stained (with sauces, yes sauces, not water marks) and had to be replaced. Our waitress was not one bit apologetic and chucked a new pair of forks at us instead.

1. We had a reservation at 8 PM, and were not seated until ~8:45 PM. What's the point of a reservation if it cannot be fulfilled? As Jerry Seinfeld once said ""You see, you know how to *take* the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation.""

2. Our server was less than enthusiastic about serving our table. We were 4 people, not like we were a group of 20 who were indecisive and scattered about. The evening wasn't all that busy, but it took him about 20 minutes after we were seating to even take our order! When we were asking his feedback on wine choices, he just didn't seem to care and wanted us to simply pick one already!

3. Finally, the zinger of the whole experience. I received a parking ticket ($100!!!) for parking on the sidewalk after using their valet service. However, I ONLY discovered I had a parking ticket from their valet service after going online to pay for a different speeding ticket I had received (unrelated). Not only did I get a ticket, but the valet failed to notify me. And WORSE than that, it was a handwritten ticket, which means they physically removed it from my car!!!

Fast forward 3 years later; friends were in from out of town and I had heard good things, so we stopped in.  The bartender that waited on us was friendly and had great wine recommendations.  When the caps game let out, the bar area got rowdy for a bit, but nothing too bad and emptied out shortly thereafter.

I walked in a few minutes earlier than a friend I was meeting and asked the hostesses if there were any seats available at the bar. They shrugged their shoulders. *gee thanks* I wandered through the bar area unable to find anything and returned to the hostesses.  I asked if I could get a table for two.  The hostess less than kindly informed me that tables are only for people planning on ordering a full meal, but I'm welcome to sit on the couch.  One hostess then proceeded to point to the couch about two feet to her left.  The seven women who were clearly in the middle of a meeting on the couch turned around and stared at me.  There was a good 10 seconds of silence as the two hostesses and the ladies on the couch stared at me waiting for a decision.  

I decided to simply leave and try to convince my friend to go elsewhere when he arrived.  Unfortunately he had read several good reviews and convinced me to go back in and give it another shot.  We went in (luckily) just as a bar table was leaving, so we quickly sat down.  The service was slow and somewhat strange.  In the course of 2 hours we managed to flag the server three times.

I had three glasses of wine each one better than the last.  (My first glass was completely unpalatable, my last glass was quite good... fruit forward but not cloying)  My friend got several appetizers.  The 'spicy meatballs' were excellent as was the chilled soup.  His duck confit though was completely unacceptable.  The fat was neither rendered nor crisped.  It may have simply been a fluke as the restaurant doesn't have the reputation for making rookie mistakes, but the duck was gross.

Overall I have no intention of coming back here.  Every other wine bar I've been to in DC has food on par, excellent wine selection, and service that doesn't make me uncomfortable.  I highly suggest any one of Sonoma, Veritas, Vinoteca, Urbana or even traveling out to Arlington to drink at Screwtop.

Our service was, in a word, awful.  It took 10 minutes to initially greet us, then the waitress failed to get a drink order.  We ordered cheese and wine to go with it ... but the wine took another 20 minutes to show up.  So we ate part of the cheese course without the wine.  The salad course came and went, and it literally took another 45 minutes for the entrees to show up.  

Its so dark in the restaurant you need a waitress-provided flashlight to read the menu.  To say nothing of being able to see your food properly.

We arrived at 7:30 and our entrees did not arrive until nearly 9:30.  Ridiculous.  No checkup from the waitress, no checking in from a host.  Clearly they had sat on the warming shelf for a bit because scallops were luke warm and the accompanying bread pudding was cold and cardboard-y.  My entree of mixed game meats was, well, gamey.  And we had zero desire to eat it by the time it finally showed up.

The cheese course was great ... but honestly, I can go to whole foods, buy some exotic cheese and sausages, and serve that myself.  

Why exactly does everyone say this place is fantastic?  Because it has a 100 page wine list of wines ranging from $150-$5000?  Who is buying these wines?

During the half hour I was there last night, the wait staff is not only rude, but incompetent.  After taking over 20 minutes for our waitress to take our order on late, quiet Saturday evening (after we asked several other waiters and busboys; she was busy attending to her boyfriend in the next table), she then dropped my full glass of wine on the table, shattering glass and liquid everywhere.  There was glass on my hand, clothes, wine on my companion's legs, just giant shards everywhere.  

Instead of apologizing or checking if anyone was hurt, she said she would bring me another glass - I, instead, asked for a towel.  However, she decided not to listen and ran off, to return 15 minutes later with another glass of wine.  The entire table and ground were soaked (we were outside), so we got up on our own and moved to another seat because she had no thought to do that on her own, or clean up her mess.  

Aside from the fact that the outside area, and inside, were rather empty, and the service was so poor in general,, her incompetence and rudeness when a customer could have been injured is unacceptable.  Upon conveying this to the manager, he insisted ""of course you will be paying for the rest of your check,"" and at no point did this pompous man inquire if either of the customers were ok after that incident.  After paying, we left, and I still wiped off glass from my skirt a half hour later.

2340,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=3dUFvpKfwhpAk7uDCilX4A,"Had an EXTREMELY disappointing first experience at Proof on Sunday night.  Six of us were looking forward to a celebratory birthday dinner and made reservations for 8pm.  When we finally (attempted) to order wine, we were told that they were ""out of many of the Austrian Whites"" and the Sommelier was summoned to help.  Fine, a wine bat can run low on wines, we rolled with the punches and order a bottle that was ultimately fine.  Then we went to menu, and asked about the appetizers.  We told that essentially all of the pates were out.  Were also told that the sweetbreads were out.  Ok, we again rolled with the punches (those some at the table were interested in the sweetbreads) and order a few items.  When it came time to order our main course, we were told that they were out of the scallops, and the salmon, because they had an 'incredibly busy' weekend.  Then I asked about the tasting menu, which includes salmon.  (We had mentioned we were interested, and he  was quick to let us know that the whole table was required to order this, but didn't seem to realize that he didn't offer an explanation as to HOW they would accommodate us since two out of the three main items were 'out'.  He told us that he thought they could still do the tasting menu, but would double check.  Ultimately, he came back to tell us they would be substituting  (for chicken and then something else) because of their shortage.  

Not wanting to eat chicken, we settled on what remained of on the menu, but first, we asked to have the butternut squash soup that is so highly recommend.  Waiter left, came back, and told us they were OUT!  Then we went through, after already being disappointed in the tasting menu, the sweetbreads, the wine, and the soup, and order a couple of hangar steaks, chicken, halibut, and 2 orders of duck.

Guess what, after ordering, the waiter came back and said they were out of the duck. 

REALLY????  Why, why, why would you allow us to study the menu, pick something, and THEN tell us you were out??  Were you hoping we would just pick something that was still in stock?  Considering that about half of your menu was NOT in stock, why not just give us the skinny in the beginning, so we can decide whether or not we want to  still eat here?

For those of you keeping track, Proof was out of the following items:

Pate
Some of their Austrian whites 
Sweetbreads
Butternut squash soup
Salmon
Scallops
Duck

Their menu is not huge.   We tried to keep it lighthearted, but it was absolutely ridiculous, and we told our waiter so much.  He at least had the sense to call the manager over (after hearing us say that we had to speak to him), and frankly, the manager was not much more helpful--simply saying that they were just crazy busy, and just ran out.  He was not nearly as apologetic as he should have been, nor did he understand that the whole situation was exacerbated by a wait staff that kept 'surprising' us with their shortages throughout the night.

When we expressed our disappointment to the waiter (and explained that it was a celebratory birthday dinner), they provided us with a butter ramekin (basically a tablespoon) full of vanilla ice cream and a sad little candle.  We didn't want nor ask for this--it was a little insulting after our experience. 

Ultimately, we had a pretty damn mediocre dinner for about $300 or so.  The manager never returned to our table at the end of the night, but did take our bottle of wine of the bill (which only half of the table drank). 

Now tell me, is this a restaurant worth visiting again??  I'm sorry, there are a lot of nice restaurants in the city that seem to run well enough to not require (1) the passing out of flashlights in order to read the menu and (2) understand their volume and (3) monitor events in the city that might affect their business (I mean, it was a three day weekend, they didn't anticipate at least some bump in their traffic) so as to ensure they could provide at least MOST of the advertised menu to their patrons!

The salads were fine, though skimpy.  But actually, all the portions were pretty small.  One main dish was OK, though uninspired, but the other was just icky.

I booked a reservation for a first-time trip to Sonoma with some friends. It was a Monday night, the restaurant was almost empty, and we were seated quickly. That was the only thing that went right.

The service was really bad from the beginning, with a waiter that disappeared periodically for long periods of time, and was rude when he came back. I understand that people have bad days, and have worked in restaurants before, so I tried to be really pleasant to him. It didn't work.

Beyond the bad service, the food was unpalatable. I really couldn't eat it. I ordered a Monday night special they have, which is spaghetti, a side salad and a glass of wine for around $20 -- a great deal for DC dining. But I couldn't eat any of it. The spaghetti's only flavor was salt -- so much salt it tasted like half of a container had just been poured on it -- and the salad was just lettuce with dressing that actually tasted like water. 

My friends' meals were equally disappointing. 

It was a really bad first time at Sonoma, but at least I learned enough to not come back. As one of my friends said while we were leaving, ""At least we came with each other, and not with people we actually have to impress!""

I was stoked to come here because I loved Mendocino, which was located in Georgetown and had spectacular service and food (at least it did two years ago). 

They had an okay wine list, it's small but not bad. We had a drink at the bar first and ordered a bottle of wine. After the initial glass we had to pour our wine for the rest of the evening, even at the dinner table. The bartender was nice but was busy and distracted. 

Our table was the best in the house. We had to wait minutes before waitstaff noticed us and we didn't even get a proper hello. We were given water. Eventually the waiter came by again, but it seemed to take forever. She seemed to be waiting on almost the entire restaurant and patio, but, even when she did attend to us, it felt like we were of low importance and a burden. It was really unpleasant. She seemed sweet, but, uncaring...it was really bizarre. 

Yes, we're rather high maintenance with ordering. But, we did our best and expressed our needs. I ordered a pizza and asked for a sunnyside egg on it. Turns out I was the second person to ask that night and the chef said no to both requests. Perhaps that's a side they need to change that policy! I ended up getting meatballs and the spaghetti. 

Our meals took forever to get to the table. There were people who were seated after us who were getting their meals before us (and they had ordered similar items like we did). When we had finished pouring our last glass of wine, the waiter came over, took the bottle and didn't even ask if we wanted another bottle. We sat for 10 minutes with just water, waiting to be asked if we wanted to order something else. When we asked why she didn't ask if we wanted another bottle, she said she was waiting until we got our dinner. I've never had that happen before - including in Sonoma, California!

After we complained, we became the bane of the restaurants existence. All the staff were giving us the classic ""there are the complainers"" looks. When we finally got our food, we loved it - the food was absolutely delicious and what I expected out of Mendocino whenever I went there. However, by the time dinner was on our table and our second bottle of wine arrived, we wanted to leave. 

Separate from service and food, both of the bathrooms smelled like urine. As if someone had peed all over the bathroom and it was never properly cleaned. This was confirmed by my guests, as well.

While my friend & I made the most of the evening, I was not happy with the surprises in with what I received from the Sonoma Wine Bar for what I paid.

The open bar was very limited, leaving most drinks one might order at the cash bar (surprise #1), the appetizers were only part of a meal that was not included in the premium tickets served earlier in the evening (surprise #2), and the photographer was roaming around taking pictures of participants--and without props--rather than free standing as one might expect with professional photography (surprise #3).  I figured the bar and food items were beyond fixing, so I asked the photographer how to order copies of pictures and was told to check the restaurant website.  After two days of seeing no new postoings, I emailed the restaurant requesting access or copies.  No reply.  I then started calling the restaurant asking when I might hear back and for a return call.  Two days later...still no reply to email or phone call.

The more we thought about it upon leaving, the more disappointed we were.  First, the waiter who greeted and seated us was delightful--had a 6 p.m. reservation, and he seated us at a banquette in the back of the restaurant immediately.  We appreciated that, but perhaps should've raised a red flag when in an almost empty restaurant, they seated 2 women right next to us when there were at least 15 empty tables in the place.  With tile floors and high ceilings, it was too noisy, and I admit, we probably should've said something then and moved to another table, but we tried to rise above it.      
Our server was a  pleasant young woman who told us about the prix fixe menu and made some helpful suggestions re:  recommendations.  We decided to order a la carte because it didn't seem as if the prix fixe would save us anything.  Upon our server's urging, we ordered the scallop appetizer, and were shocked when it came and there were 2 scallops of the plate--2!
Again, another moment when we should've said--forgetabout it and  left.  I think the appetizer was $11 (0r more!), so we paid $5.50 per scallop, and they were good, but certainly not that good!  
We shared a mediocre bibb salad that from the description of what was supposed to be in it, ought to have been wonderful.  It wasn't.

Hubby's pork was over-cooked, and the cabbage that accompanied it was mediocre, at best.  My char was good, but such a small piece, and the accompaniments on the plate were so small  it was almost embarrassing.  
We don't want lots of food on our plate, but for what we paid, we feel we should have at least had a little more food on our plates!  
We kept trying--apple tarte for dessert was just OK, though our server said 'like your mother used to make,' which it certainly wasn't.  It wasn't even warmed up, and the scoop of icecream was miniscule.
To add insult to injury, we were charged for 2 prix fixe dinners though we made it clear to our server we didn't want them--so the bill had to be adjusted $14. For a grand total of $114, we were disappointed and feel that the menu is too ambitious for whoever's doing the cooking, the cost for what we got was way too high, and the food just OK.

After that happened, for what felt like eternity, we walked out without a goodbye or concern from anyone. I've never felt so invisible or witnessed such poor customer service.

When I went up to the bar, waited about 5 minutes to grab the Bartender's attention - he was talking about a mixtape with some other patrons - I requested silverware for the table, more coffee, and if I could possibly still get that salad. We waited for about ten minutes for silverware and after about fifteen my salad arrived, yay. During which, our bartender told us he was completely hungover so it was, ""his bad"" - eloquently stated. Sadly enough, additional coffee never arrived. Nor did water refills.

Not worth the fuss, the fiasco about the seating,nor the price. I was extremely disappointed in Vinoteca service-wise certainly, but also food-wise. It was just so mediocre.

We went here on Friday night... they were busy and had no tables, but were happy to offer us two stools at their countertop (not actually at the bar, behind the bar).  Not a really great seat, there is a large support post or wall that pretty much sits 6"" off of the counter, so it's a bit awkward, but oh well.  Strangely, there were 3 stools adjacent that appeared empty and available, but the person who sat us down said that friends of the manager were sitting there.  The three stools sat empty for about 15 minutes... So we sat and enjoyed our awkard seating arrangement with a great view of the wall.  Our intent was to order appetizers, then have a seat at a table when one opened up for dinner.

After perusing the menu we ordered a bunch of appetizers and were just about to order drinks...  suddenly I get a tap on the shoulder and a man (one of the manager's friends) telling me to get out of his way as he starts to shove my stool.  I wasn't ""in his way"" ... my stool hadn't been moved any closer to his stool.. and most importantly, there was certainly no need to be so rude to me as a paying customer without first asking politely.  and physically shoving me out of the way was way beyond appropriate.  what a chach. it's one thing if a place is full of  douche bags, maybe they can't help that...  but for a manager to allow non paying customers to be so rude to paying customers to the point of making them leave (and wanting to start a fight) is just a recipe for disaster.

I've been to this place twice within a year. SLOW and LESS-than-mediocre service both times.  I work at a wine bar... and my sister pointed out ""The Wine Taster Challenge"" in the wine list thinking it would be fun. It's 20 bones to try 3 wines (2.5oz pours). AND the catch is, if you can name the varietal, country, region... It's on the house. I also thought this would be fun to show off to my friends since a few colleagues at work call me ""the nose."" Well, it wasn't as fun as I thought it was going to be. I wasn't even completely through with my first taste, when I go and check my phone for a second, look up, and someone bussed my glass away! I wasn't going to let that happen again, so I kept a close eye on the next 2 glasses.  Now, I was well aware that it was Wednesday and they would be closing at 10 (we were walking out the door no later than 10:15p... I'm in the business too and I know the game), but I hadn't even gotten through the final taste when our waitress dropped the check... Didn't even bother asking if I knew what they were (which I did) and I was expecting some sort of overview... but I was only handed a bill.  ...Heh! Really??...What was the point of doing the challenge in the first place??? My friend had to phone the girl to come back out so I could disclose my feedback on my tastings of this silly scheme they display on their menu (they were all inexpensive wines btw--about $4-$5 a TASTE... I double checked the menu for what they charge for only a taste!--kinda crazy they charge $20 for the ""challenge""). When she finally came back, her attitude was very unpleasant as I was naming off the wines. Thank heavens I was spot on!!!  FREE wine... yes.

I'm not a wine aficionado by any means, but I like shiraz, so I ordered the cheap $28 bottle to split with a couple friends. The waitress said they were out, so the two other shiraz wines (about $50 and $60) would be the same price... or so I thought. I asked her which one she suggested -- she recommended the $60 one (naturally)

When the bill came, it was still listed as $60. I thought it was a mistake and politely reminded her that she had said the two others were the same price. She insisted she hadn't said that. Instead, she explained, she had said another Shiraz called ""two-beck"" was the same price (I'm sure that's misspelled, but that's how it's pronounced). 

I told her that we heard ""two others,"" not ""two beck,"" but she insisted that I owed the full price. I asked to speak to the manager, who was very rude and also insisted I owed the full amount. This is crazy -- if I initially ordered the cheapest shiraz, why would I suddenly change my mind to the most expense one? I asked the manager if he thought I was being unreasonable, and he suggested I was.  I told him I'd split the difference and give them $40.

Of course, this was a very simple mistake -- the waitress probably didn't annunciate well, and I probably misheard. No biggie. This sort of thing happens all the time. But both the waitress and manager were rude and seemed to insinuate we were trying to scam them. Best case scenario, the manager poorly handled a simple mistake. Worst case scenario, Vinoteca intentionally pulled a bait and switch. 

I would have expected better treatment from a table that dropped $300.

3508,Vinoteca,/user_details?userid=aHrKRzRI-97jVvkdUbVcQw,"I hate to write this review of Vinoteca, which has been one of my favorite spots in DC over the past few years.  As you can tell, I wrote a review almost two years ago in which I praised Vinoteca for its wonderful service and food.  However, my experience on New Year's Eve was deplorable, both in terms of service and food.  Despite several attempts to resolve these issues with our waitress and management over the course of the evening, my husband and I left feeling like we'd been ripped off.

On New Years Eve, Vinoteca offered a five-course menu with optional wine pairings.  We opted out of the pairings, and instead decided to order wines by the glass with each course.  After a significant wait, during which other tables were brought bread and an amuse bouche, we asked our waitress if we could order wine.  Having previously relied upon Vinoteca's waitstaff for recommendations, we described what we were looking for to our waitress.  She recommended the most expensive wines on the menu--literally, the most expensive two for each of us.  When we suggested a less expensive pairing (we were hoping to spend less than $18-20 per glass), she was unenthusiastic.  We ended up choosing off the menu without any assistance.

After placing our food orders, we proceeded to wait about 15 minutes while other tables (we were part of the 9 p.m. seating) were given bread and an amuse bouche.  Finally, our appetizers arrived.  Then the amuse bouche.  We were annoyed, but decided to let it go.  Still, we requested bread and ate our first course.  The waitstaff, however, was determined to clear our plates before we were finished--they tried several times despite the fact that we had food left on our plates and were actively eating.  Finally, we asked our server if we could please finish our first course before it was cleared.

The second course--the best course--arrived.  It then took an additional 3-4 minutes for our silverware to arrive.  When we were halfway finished eating the second course, our main course arrived.  We politely asked to send it back, noting that we had half of our previous course in front of us.  Keep in mind that there was no one coming in after us, so turnover was not an issue.

When our entrees arrived, they were room temperature and we were again left without silverware (there was no silverware for 3 of the 5 courses).  My husband and I decided to try to forgive this error, and proceeded to bite into our meals.  My trout, which was barely warm, was completely raw in the center.  I eat raw fish, and have an unparalleled love of sushi.  Yet unintentionally raw fish is never good, so I alerted our waitress to this problem.  She took the food back, saying that it would be only a few minutes.  My husband, trying to be polite, waited for me to get my food to eat.  It took approximately fifteen minutes for my fish to arrive, meaning that my husband's bison was now cool to the touch.  We asked for a manager, who came over to see what the problem was.  We explained, she was polite and reheated the bison (meaning it was now overcooked), and brought us a few shreds of ham and cheese.  Keep in mind, the next course was a charcuterie plate, so it wasn't exactly what we were looking for...

The final two courses were as dismal as the first three (I actually could not bite into a piece of the meat due to the high level of fat), and service did not improve.  We again asked for wine recommendations, and were again pointed towards the most expensive ones on the menu.  As you can imagine, we disregarded her suggestions.

At the end of the night, the check came for approximately $225.  No discount, nothing taken off the check.  I have worked in the food service industry for several years, and have worked under various managers.  I cannot imagine a situation in which a manager would not offer a round of drinks or so something special to make up for this experience, especially when we have frequented the restaurant so many times.  We again asked to speak to a manager, who never made it back to our table.  The check reappeared with a discount, bringing it to approximately $190.  My husband and I love to dine out, and we are willing to spend a significant amount of money on good service and food.  To pay nearly $200 for less than mediocre food and terrible service is not worth it in a town where a memorable experience is not difficult to find.

I did not hate Rustik when it was in the space, but it was unmemorable enough to not add to my regular Bloomingdale circuit. Tyber Creek is a marked regression in quality on every front.

The first thing is that the owners of the restaurant have managed to pack an uncomfortable number of seats into a small space. The acoustics are not terrible, so it's not overly loud, but it is a tight squeeze. 

I went with friends for lunch, and here's where things go massively downhill. We each ordered different dishes, and we were each unanimous that it was the worst food we could remember eating. The shakshuka looked and tasted like a can of tomato paste was poured into a bowl with unseasoned eggs and poorly cooked potatoes. The soft scrambled eggs were a debacle: the eggs were not seasoned (at all) and overcooked. The lettuce was sad and poorly presented. The bacon was massively overcooked and came out room temperature. I had the burger. At $15, I would be embarrassed to work for a restaurant that served as pathetic an excuse for a dish as this. The meat was overcooked, the bun was no better than a store brand day old roll, the lettuce was lacking in crispness, the onion came in a hunk, and the side salad was just a few leaves that looked like they were crying out for help.

My friend asked for the eggs to be recooked with his meal, and they came out slightly better cooked but still without seasoning. 

Bright spots, if there were any: the cinnamon rolls were not inedible. The bourbon smash I had was pretty good. The space is recently renovated and seating is fairly comfortable (if squished).

The theme of the restaurant is unclear and lacks any sense of consistency.

I would absolutely not return, and I would advise anyone else against going. My guess is that they will do fine with business from people who are unwilling to wait five or ten minutes for a table at the vastly superior Boundary Stone, El Camino, or Bacio. Crisp is far better on price and food, but the space isn't particularly nice, and the wait time for meals to come out can be lengthy. 

I hope the owners get the chance to do a total rethink of the menu and kitchen execution. I would also note the percentage of Yelp reviews that are from folks who don't live in the neighborhood.

Even when I sent it back and got eggs that were cooked properly, it was still clear that there was no step between the eggs being cracked and whisked and them being thrown on the griddle.

We ordered a few cocktails and entrees. The food was delicious. The drinks were also really good. Unfortunately, the waiter was extremely rude. He took forever to tend to our table. He never greeted us and actually looked annoyed after we all sat down. He never smiled while serving us and we had to constantly call him over in order to place our orders. He addressed one person at a time (at a table of 7) and then walked away. Perhaps he had a bad day, but It was very frustrating.

When we told the owner, Justin Logan about the issue with the waiter and his poor customer service, he defended the waiter. He came over and said, ""Something smells fishy over here"".

We ended up waiting almost 2.5 hours for a table. Obviously we weren't happy. Having gone to many similar echelon places in the area, we do understand that this happens from time to time, but in many of the surrounding restaurants, they've done something to make it up to you. When we sat down, the table next to us said ""did you guys wait forever too?"" and of course we said yes. They even had a RESERVATION and had to wait forever. They were nice people and we brought it up to the manager that they too had waited forever. The INCREDIBLY RUDE manager looked at us and said that he would make it up to them but that he wouldn't do anything for us because ""I don't give anything to people that ask."" All of us at our table who have worked in the industry before know that mistakes happen, but that is hands down not good management.

We got there a few minutes early, and our table wasn't ready so we amazingly found seats at the bar. Quickly we were offered a table by the host and took it. We ordered their flights of wine, but told the waitress we weren't going to order any entrees since we'd already eaten. She then proceeded to tell the host we weren't ordering dinner, and the host then came over and very rudely informed us that you were required to order food at the tables. (We were even told cheese didn't count as a food). However, we could stand in a crammed hallway to drink our wine since we had lost our bar seats and were actually asked to get up from the table. We obviously left as a result and went to a wine bar down the street that actually allowed us to sit anywhere and order only drinks.

Some background-we eat out 3+ days a week at similarly priced restaurants, so we had pretty high expectations for Cork.  That being said, I don't think this was a case off setting the bar too high... Cork was really disappointing.  Bottom line: If you want a good wine bar with great food-go to Proof.  

First, let's talk about the wine list.  If a restaurant is going to market itself as a ""wine bar,"" it should have a fairly extensive list of wines by the glass.  It is pretty clear that the owners favor french wines, and while the Italian and Spanish wines were fine, it would have been nice to have a variety of wines from other regions.  The wine by the glass selection was small and really disappointing.  

I also thought the flight concept was executed poorly.  Only one flight of reds?  If you want a true flight experience, go to Veritas.  

The food-if a dish wasn't bad, it was just meh.  Avoid the steak at all costs.  Admittedly, we had just come off a visit at Acqua Al 2 where we had some of the best steak in the city (seriously, run to Acqua and try their steak sampler).  That being said, this tasted like tough dog meat.  It was TERRIBLE. 

The cheese selection was also a disappointment.  The cow girl creamery cheese tasted like a dirty shoe.  Though, to be fair, the goat cheese and bread served with the plate were good.

The halibut was fine, but nothing special and the bowl of olives were mushy. 

My favorite dish of the evening was the kale--a side order.  

On top of this, Cork is really expensive given the portion sizes.  Our bill with tip totaled $150, so given our disappointment, we left angry.   We could have had a much better meal, FOR LESS MONEY, down the street at Posto...

When we entered, we were asked if we wanted dinner. No, we said, just wine -- seeing as how Cork is a wine bar and all.  We were told that tables don't open up for mere drinkers until 11:30, so we'd have to find a seat at the bar.  

The bar is too small.  There were no seats.  And it was loud, very loud.  Meanwhile, half of the tables in the ""wine bar"" (restaurant?) sat empty.  One of the hostesses must have noticed how forlorn we looked and asked what she could do.  We explained that we just wanted to drink some wine, but that there was no room at the bar and they wouldn't let us sit at one of the empty tables.  She stared back blankly, then suggested that they could bring out another bar stool.  We failed to grasp the value of this gesture, since there was barely room at the bar for one more person, sandwiched between two larger parties.  We declined, and they let us walk out.  

I was hoping for a pleasant night in a wine bar, but Cork seems to be trying to be too many things at once.  What kind of wine bar doesn't let you sit down and drink a bottle of wine?

I have now been to Cork at least 4 times (every time saying that it will be my last...then wanting to give the place another try. Put a cork in me; I'm DONE.) On my first trip, I tried to search online for a place I could make a reservation, and the website said to call directly. I called, a woman, who I think was Diane the owner, picked up and asked me to hold. I held. And held. And held. For 15-20 minutes. Finally I hung up and called back...no one answers. Riiiing, no one answers. I decide to go and just wait at the bar vs. on the phone. When I walk in, I politely tell Diane what had happened when I tried to make a reservation. She looked at me condescendingly and made some comment about how busy she was. Really??? 

Fast forward to my second visit. The wine is corked. The bartender doesn't believe me and gives me an attitude. I do understand these things happen though...so, I give it another try... 

Third visit, I go to grab a drink and some food with the owner of nearby Posto and also of Tosca. We get a table right away, service is prompt, food is hot although nothing to write home about. Completely different attitude toward my business than any of the past visits.  This explains why the place has good ratings from food critics, yet the reader comments after the official ratings are so low.

I come across one really great Barbera d'Asti and decide I want to buy a bottle / case. I walk over to the table where they were serving it to ask for one more small taste to determine how much I wanted to purchase. The pourer Doug (I think?) looks at me disdainfully and tells me that they aren't pouring ""extra"" tastes for people and that they have 200 people to get through at the event. He begrudgingly gives me a tiny bit more. Really???? In my opinion, events like this are meant to (1) enhance customer loyalty and delight; (2) sell wine; (3) educate consumers about the product.

We recently tried Cork, and had mixed feelings.  When we first arrived, the hostess tried to seat us in the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen.  There wasn't enough room to sit on one side of the table, due to it being jammed against the back of another table.  We thought to pull out the table, but then realized we would be in the direct route of the servers to and from the kitchen.  
In addition, we were seated next to an adorable child who was very unhappy and belted out screams to let us know.  We asked for a different table and was told that we could sit at the bar (there were tables for 4 available, but we were told we couldn't sit at them).  Taking this suggestion, we found 2 seats and had an excellent bartender.  He allowed us to try 2 wines before recommending a fabulous bottle of white.  Although they had an extensive selection of wines by the glass, the 2 we tried must have been their worst.  I really enjoy a nice dry French rose (which can be difficult to find at most restaurants), and the one they had listed as a French rose was more like a white zinfandel that I can pick up at any store for $5/bottle.  The bartender misunderstood me when I said that I liked a ""dry"" rose.

We ordered a cheese plate, and asked the server to pick out 3 cheeses for us.  This was fabulous - we loved the selection (although a bit small for $10).  We had also ordered calamari, steak and fries.  The cheese came out first, then the steak and fries.  The steak was wonderful - cooked to perfection and a nice size for the price.  The fries were extremely overdone and took a few tastes to get used to the sauce that accompanied them.  When we finally finished everything, the server asked if we had ever received the calamari.  Since we had already finished our meal/wine, and had ordered the calamari at least an hour or more prior to this, we assumed the kitchen forgot, so we took our servers offer to just remove it from our bill.  5 min later, our server came out with the calamari and asked if we wanted it explaining that it just came up.  We again said ""no thanks"" and he agreed.  No more than 2 minutes after this, another gentleman (he introduced himself as the owner) came out with the same plate of calamari.  He explained to us that since Cork is a ""tapa's/small plate"" restaurant, the food can come out at any time and in any order.   Now I have been to tapa's places all around the DC area and have never had an item that was ordered over an hour ago arrive and been expected to eat and pay for it.  I realize some plates take longer to cook/prepare than others, but I've never had to wait that long for fried calamari.  The owner was very pushy and rude about the entire situation.  He agreed to take it off the bill, but was reluctant.  Face it, they simply forgot, just let it go - right??  Apparently not.

I was extremely disappointed in the actions of the owner.  I thought that he was unprofessional and rude.  Because of this, I would NOT recommend this restaurant to ANYONE and will NEVER go back.  I can find much better wines/food/service/prices at other restaurants in the DC metro area and enjoy a more pleasant experience.  Go to ""Proof"" instead!

3999,Cork Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=kL-67nJ4wv8yPlwzQmjOsA,"I wanted to love Cork. I really really did! I talked about going to Cork for months and months before having dinner there a few weeks ago for a friend's going away party. I even had the goat cheese cheesecake and two of my favorite wines. But Cork almost completely disappointed me. 

We had a fun table right next to the kitchen so we could watch the cooks/chefs prepare our dinner items. That was nice. But the tables were INCREDIBLY close together and some of our group could barely fit into their chairs because the table behind them was pulled so close.

We ordered about 15 dishes to share among the 7 of us. Approximately 10 of the dishes were vegetarian and they all came out quickly and fresh. The 5 meat dishes didn't come out and didn't come out and didn't come out. We asked several times and the waiter admitted that he forgot to put in the 5 meat dishes. Huh? Weird. They eventually came out but were kind of cold and the steaks were not cooked according to our requests (they were extremely well-done when we asked for medium). 

To top off the evening, we decided to split the bill on two credit cards: mine and one other guy at the table. He and I took cash from everyone else and split the bill in half. I signed my slip (with 50% of the bill on it) and he signed his- or at least what the waiter told him was his. Two days later, the entire charge showed up on my bill. I thought it was a minor mistake so I called and spoke to Cork's manager, Diane. She was nice but didn't seem to understand what a gaff this was. I gave her our server's name and the receipt number and my credit card information. She said she would look into it and get back to me ASAP. I didnt't receive a call from her for 2 days. I called back. Again, she was nice and [somewhat] apologetic but didn't have an answer OR a solution for me. She asked if I knew the other guy who split the bill with me and if I could get in touch with him. I didn't really know him (just through a friend) and asked if she could figure out what happened before I tried to track him down. If my card accidentally got charged twice, she could just refund me, right? No. She didn't know how to refund a credit card. Remember, this is the manager of Cork we are talking about. I called again several days later (after a weekend) and left a message. No call back. I called the next day (yesterday) and she said ""Oh, hi Alexandra. I think I figured out what happened. The bill was split in half but both halves were put on your card. The other guy in your group signed on your credit card. I need to call my merchant to see how to refund you."" JEEZ. There was a short and nice apology but no offer of a meal voucher or free dessert- even after all the days (3 weeks!) I've been trying to get this resolved. In the end, I found the email for my friend of a friend and asked him to just write me a check for his 1/2 so we could avoid waiting for Cork to ""find out how to refund a credit card"". When I proposed this solution to Diane (in a very accommodating and friendly way) she said ""oh, that's so nice of you. Thank you for being so helpful. I'm still going to call my merchant because I should know how to do a refund on a credit card for the future."" You think? 

Wouldn't you, as a manager of a restaurant that f-ed up someone's bill and put twice the amount on someone's credit card, offer some gift of apology or gratitude? Maybe a free dessert? Or a free bottle of wine with dinner? C'mon. This is the service industry we're dealing with here!!

Very disappointing. Double check your bill when  you go to Cork.

Considering the sizable wait, it would have been appropriate to prepare a place to wait. With the seats at the bar full, my options were to wait in the dingy U St. rain or to be pinned awkwardly between dining customers.  We thought it a victory when we discovered a hallway to the back of the restaurant only to learn it was the only path to the kitchen.   A place to ""stand"".

We waited an eternity. And once the eternity expired, we were asked to wait longer. Only when they discovered we were displeased with their service did a table mysteriously become available. Furthermore, the management was incredibly unforgiving as my license had very recently expired. I was forced to sit in sobriety as my friends choked down a subpar red. The table was conveniently located next to the hostess' table, where the owner, manager, and hostess had a clear view if i were to, god-forbid, take a sip of a friends wine.  Though it was a wine bar, our waitress was incredibly unknowledgable about their wine list.

4076,Slate Wine Bar + Bistro,/user_details?userid=T61Xaiq3JK_6gFKTKJmm2Q,"I am not one to write Yelp reviews for restaurants but my awful experience at Slate Wine Bar + Bistro two weekends ago necessitated a review. 

It was Restaurant Week when my friend and I had planned to go and we had made a reservation for 12:45 PM on a Sunday. My friend called Slate at 11:30 AM before our reservation to ask if they were offering both the lunch and brunch restaurant menu that day. The employee who answered our call (his name was John) informed my friend that both menus would be available and we were stoked, since we were more interested in the lunch menu. We arrived right at 12:45 PM, gave our name, and turns out that they can't find our reservation...interesting. Fortunately, there was a table available and we were seated. The restaurant owner brought us silverware and filled our cups with water, and ended up pouring water all over the table. He did not seem very apologetic about it and rather than swap out the soaked table cloth, he brought over a cloth napkin to cover the table instead. We proceeded to ask him for the lunch menu since we were under the impression that it was available but instead he laughs and says that there is ""no lunch menu, only brunch."" We thought he was joking given the laughs and asked again, and he then informed us that ""there is no way someone from my staff told you that we have the lunch menu available on Sunday."" We were respectful about this and stuck to the brunch menu, picking duck egg rolls and doughnut balls for appetizer, chicken and waffles for the entree, and sugar cookies for dessert. Between all of this, we asked our waiter for lemon slices about four times until he brought some to our table. Despite all of the problems, we were still understanding of the fact that the restaurant was busy and they seemed short-staffed so we didn't make a fuss. 

As for mealtime, I will say that the duck egg rolls were good. The doughnut balls, however, were a pathetic take on doughnuts. It felt like I was eating an overlying sugared puff of air and I was eager for my chicken and waffles to arrive since I was still very hungry. Unfortunately, the entree didn't impress either. The waffle was decent but the portion of the chicken was ridiculously underwhelming, lacked complete flavor, and was some sub-par meat.  The chicken was basically inedible so I was stuck to the waffle instead. At this point, we were so disappointed with our meal and the experience that we quickly asked for the check and a to-go box for our cookies. Rather than starting a fuss about our experience during their busy restaurant hours that Sunday, we wrote a short note on the receipt about the service and my friend and I we'd call the management the following day.

I called on Monday and relayed our negative experience to an employee who was in training to become a manager. I wish I had remembered his name because he was incredibly apologetic, very understanding, and told me he was committed to addressing this with the owner who happened to be out of the restaurant during the time I called. He informed me the owner would call me in the next couple of days.

On Wednesday, two days after our initial call, I was contacted by the owner. Immediately upon picking up the phone, he was incredibly hostile. He stated that he was ""offended"" that I even asked if the lunch menu was available, he wanted to kick me and my friend out because he thought were being disrespectful in his restaurant, and he also said I was LYING about John saying the lunch menu was available that Sunday. He also cussed me out over the phone and I was in complete shock that this was the conversation I was having with someone who owns a restaurant. Lastly, he hung up on me as I was mid-sentence. 

If you are every considering going here, I recommend re-thinking your decision. Their food leaves much to be desired, they lack compassion for their patrons, and if a problem arises, I doubt they will do anything to remedy it. There are many other restaurant up and down Wisconsin Avenue to try so I highly suggest giving someplace else a try!

Second- know your area. You clearly are not from the Glover Park area because you are doing everything completely wrong.  White table cloths in Glover Park - are we in 1995?  Glover Park consists most of young mid 20 staffers who want to know wine and want to enjoy wine.  And what do you guys do - ruin that for everyone.  You put obscure wines that even a CSW in wine such as myself have never heard of.  I understand that you want to offer a different choice, and trust me I appreciate that, but you have to offer something to these hardworking millennial that want nothing more than to learn the love of wine. Stop being arrogant to this.    

I know your game - you do this because you think you know it all and you think what you like the general public will like.  I also know that you responded to other yelpers saying that these wines are organic and cost more. False - I looked them up in the beverage journal and you are not using fair prices at all.  You chose obscure wines that cannot be found anywhere so that you can mark up your By the Glass pricing.

Here was a couple eager to try, but you lost them because of your arrogance of putting such an obscure list together.  Once he did choose which wine, you then proceeded to bring him the wrong bottle....YOU the owner, not the server.
Which leads me to the point that your servers were not educated in your obscure varietals, vintages, or vineyard designations.  My boyfriend ended up ordering a beer which was poured into a wine glass - which was just bizarre.  Why do you offer Heineken bottles but not one name brand on your wine list. It seems you are so confused as how to own a real wine bar. Come on  and offer something that people know - if you are going to do it on your beer list with a beer as disgusting, not to mention demographically incorrect, as Heineken, please do it to your wine list.

You only had three tables full, it was a Wednesday night, the bar was completely empty, I cant imagine you were so busy to not ask us how our meal was. You are a new restaurant, why don't you welcome people in - is it because you want your institution to feel as cold as the ambiance? I don't get it. I just don't get it.  
Bottom line - it is great to want to own a wine bar, it is not great to be arrogant.  Your food does not match what a wine bar food should be. You have no good cheeses to go with wine - halloumi... really? You offer veggie sandwiches and Salomon, your chef looks like a unique guy, i am pretty sure you can come up with better food pairings and create nice unique seasonal foods to go with your wines.  YOu might want to take a stroll down to Ripple (while it is not my favorite place - but they are doing things right...) their menu compliments wine perfectly...how can you not have an extensive cheese list?????  
If you want to be obscure and eclectic great - offer wine flights so people don't feel intimidated to try new and different wines.  Put better descriptions on the wine menu, and most importantly EDUCATE your staff.

I walked in and asked whether my flag football team could come in between 3:30 and 4:00 and still get the bottomless brunch.  I was told we would have to get in our food orders quickly and they would bring out as much as we could fit on the table, but that the kitchen would shift to dinner prep at 4:00.  However, if we wanted to do the bottomless drinks, we could have the full two hours of that since those didn't depend on the kitchen.

This sounded perfect.  We showed up at 3:40.  They took a few minutes to set up a table, and eventually a waiter came to us around 3:50.  I told him our request, and he said that there was no way to get brunch food out of the kitchen before 4:00.  I said fine, we would order off of the regular menu, but could we at least get the bottomless drinks as previously promised?  This was refused as well.

The waiter then proceeded to take 2 out of the 9 people's food and drink orders ... then just left the table.  He was gone for quite a while, then began waiting on other tables.  Between 4:15 and 4:20 we got his attention and asked whether he would be taking more food or drink orders, and when we would be getting at least our drinks.  Without apology, he explained that the kitchen was still transitioning over to dinner service and that it did not make sense to order food since we would not be able to be served soon.  He offered no explanation for why he did not take more drink orders, nor why we had not received the few drink orders we'd made.

Needless to say, the above-referenced service was pretty terrible.  Hungry and irritated, we relatively politely explained that since we were hungry then we would be leaving.  The team spends roughly $500 a week on brunch/lunch at chinatown restaurants.  We have had nothing but positive experiences at nearby restaurants like Zengo or R.F.D. to name a few.  This was the polar opposite of a positive experience.

I've lived across the street from this restaurant for some time.  It seems to change its name a lot  (this is the site of the now-defunct Tel'veh), but I wonder if it is the same management.  [It is basically the same brunch deal that Tel'veh used to have].  I gave the spot a chance because they seemed so reasonable when I walked in and asked about brunch timing at 1:30, and I figured that maybe the negative features of Tel'veh might be gone.  But they're not.

I can't rate the food since we were never served, but I'll say that Zengo's unlimited brunch menu food is delicious (try the Angry Zengo Roll and Hanoi Pandan Pancakes -- they're amazing), they're just two blocks away, and the difference in service is well worth the walk.

I really did. So much so that we bought the open table coupon and decided to try it out. We're young people on a budget, but it seemed like a worthwhile splurge. 

But then we got there. Already they lose points for the unisex bathrooms, but that wouldn't make or break an experience for me (see my review of Hank's Oyster Bar--awesome food, gross unisex bathrooms). The appetizers were at best overpriced and at worst bland--three ice cream scoops of spreads that made me wishing I was at Zaytinya eating their mound of hummus with piping hot bread. 

Main course was ok--watch out for the major upsell. The waitress kept asking if we wanted more, would this be enough, and she seemed to be passing on some harsh judgment that we would not be ordering enough. I appreciate the portion-control concern and all, but figure that if we're old enough to pay for the meal, then we're probably able to figure out how much we need to eat. 

Dessert. Much hyped about. Total let down. They handed us the menu and were out of the one item they featured as a ""must try"" and we wanted. Guests with us had the same experience the last time they were there. So it sounds like they can talk a big game but not actually serve the dessert they are featuring? Lame. Not a dealbreaker--but lame. 

But then the dealbreaker came along--we went to pay. We had the online version of the Open Table coupon, the one where we read the fine print and it said nothing about needing a hard copy. Nothing. At All. 

But they refused to accept it unless it was in hard copy form--a rule they had neglected to post on the coupon, yet insisted on enforcing. Yes, they did have a printer. No, we could not use it. Yes, we're going to take it up with Open Table. Yes, we were pissed. Irony of it all? They said, well you get to come back now. Just not on a Saturday when you can't use the coupon anyway. 

Overall--total fail of an experience. I really don't want to go back. It seems like I have $50 to spend there, might as well use it (the whole adage of cutting your nose off to spite your face comes to mind). 

So undecided on that part. I can tell you this much--if I were paying for the meal entirely out of pocket, no way I would go back.

I hope my girlfriend isn't reading this, because despite her lovely presence and a very nice bottle of wine (which I brought), it was probably the worst $100/person food I have ever experienced.

I was surprised upon arriving by a special fixed price menu.  I did not see this menu on their website when I booked our reservation last week, but my girlfriend spied it a few hours before our meal.  I knew I was a bit sunk as soon as I saw the menu.  Bistro Lepic is a good restaurant (based on my previous visits), but it is not a $70 fixed price menu restaurant.  And Valentine's Day did not transform it into something it is not.

It actually transformed Bistrot Lepic into a hideous cliche of Barry White and bad food (We actually liked the Barry White).  First course, beet napoleons, which were just a couple beets cut into heart shapes with a smear of goat cheese.  Ok, I can handle a little bit of valentine's cheesiness and the dish was not great, but also not regrettable.  For the next course, I went with the lobster, which was an $8 surcharge, but if I'm on the hook for this kind of dinner, I might as well go all in.  What arrived was the worst lobster I have ever been served anywhere.  It had an odd, slightly fishy smell, very little flavor, and the telltale texture of (freezer burn?).  I briefly thought about sending it back, but I would not have dared doing such a thing on Valentine's Day in a crowded restaurant.  I sucked it up.  The third course was a chocolate cake and a cheesecake, I think.  It was hard to tell because both were stale and flavorless.  They had obviously been made long before and then left to dry out for a full day in the fridge.  Both were again cut in the shape of hearts which made them so much less appealing.  The night ended with a huge bill and a rose for my girlfriend, another clumsy cliched move that felt creepy and made me want to get out of there even faster.

Our entire group showed up on time (sorry  - that's saying something - it's hard to get 17 people to show up on time) and we were told that they had confused our reservations (not possible) and that we needed to come back at 9:30.  Without much fuss, we went next door to some new Asian restaurant and grabbed drinks until 9:30.  When we showed up at 9:30 they still weren't ready for us - turns out they had another party in the private room that had shown up late.  This would have been good to know the first time we showed up on time.  We stood outside the room and waited and watched as they set up the table.  After we finally sat down it was after 10PM.  Needless to say - it was midnight before they started to bring out the cheese course.  When we asked to just get the bill - they skipped the cheese - brought out the dessert and then charged us for everything.  I'm sorry - but one glass of champagne per person did not make up for the amount of time that we spent waiting around.  I will never come back to Bistrot Lepic and I would recommend that any big group stay away from this restaurant.  I'm so disappointed that my friends had to pay $100/person for this nonsense.

4913,Bistrot Lepic & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=VlI1CxW1VawvH_vv7t2mEg,"I have been to Bistro Lepic quite a few times over the years and was exceptionally disappointed on my last two visits.  First, the food is now just so-so and overpriced for what it is:  average french-american fare and nothing special. It's gone downhill and was better several years ago. I had a strange looking salmon dish that was  completely coated with a thick potato gratin (?) that was no different than a fast food hash brown. The grape sauce that topped it off was bland and had a refrigerator flavor.  Moving onto atmosphere: they advertise a wine bar upstairs that now suffers an identity crisis with a very rude maitre d' (other reviewers mention him as well).  There used to be live jazz background music in the wine bar for the last 2-3 years but it has turned into a ""Las Vegas"" style show on Monday and Wednesday evenings. It's a nice space but  I was with two other colleagues enjoying our wine when the band called Bitter Dose started to play. Decent group for a swing dance I suppose  (I'm a regular at Glen Echo) but absolutely not for a ""refined"" wine bar!  The music was carnival like and distracting which killed our otherwise enjoyable conversation and attempt to unwind for the evening. How about some quality music that is unobtrusive allowing the customers to ""tune in"" and out of their conversations at their discretion?   This wine bar basically felt like an American style pub once the music kicked in.  We passed on dessert as a result and left early.  In summary, what used to be one of my favorites has become a surprising disappointment.
