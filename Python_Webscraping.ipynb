When our wine arrived she took the time to explain each glass (9 glasses between the three of us) and told us it's origin and so forth. \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the Virginia flight, the sauvignon blanc flight and the Spanish reds flight. As a huge fan of sauvignon blanc, I wasn't a huge fan of this flight as all of the wines were infused with other things - not just sauvignon blanc. This seemed odd considering it was the \\\\\"sauvignon blanc\\\\\" flight but good to know for next time...\\\\n\\\\nThe clear winner of the night was definitely my roommate's spanish reds flight.

Don't get me wrong, I love Proof, but the bill can really add up sometimes, so it's nice to have a good, less expensive option nearby  Having said that, Flight is sort of an odd space; the curved bar with seats for 16 is interesting, with what appears to be a tree growing behind it, but the rest of it is a bit drab.   \\\\n\\\\nBut you're not really here for that are you?  You're here for the wine, and I'm here to tell you that it's worth the visit for their thoughtful and interesting selection.  Bored of Bordeaux?  Tired of Tempranillo?  Flight has unusual, inexpensive, and often overlooked grape varietals such a Serbian Prokupac, Hungarian Kekfrankos, and Georgian Rkatsiteli.  And since this is Flight, they of course serve flights of wine with choices such as the Ottoman Empire (whites from Greece, Slovenia, and Georgia) and Austro-Hungarian Empire (a mix of white and ros\\\\u00e9s from the aforementioned countries).  \\\\n\\\\nThe glassware is short and boxy, and pours are available in half and full pours.  No cocktails, but they offer liquor and four draft beers with another nine beers and ciders in bottles and cans, including Stillwater Stateside Saison and Evolution Lucky No. 7 Porter.

Just far enough off the 7th street mayhem, Flight is an intimate spot perfect for catching up with girlfriends or date night. \\\\n\\\\nMy roommates and I were looking to try a bar in the chinatown neighborhood and ruled out that Flight was the one place all three of us had never been. We arrived on a chilly Friday evening and were warmly greeted by Fiona our bartender. She took care of us explaining the drink menu in detail and helped us choose some great flights. When our wine arrived she took the time to explain each glass (9 glasses between the three of us) and told us it's origin and so forth. \\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the Virginia flight, the sauvignon blanc flight and the Spanish reds flight. As a huge fan of sauvignon blanc, I wasn't a huge fan of this flight as all of the wines were infused with other things - not just sauvignon blanc. This seemed odd considering it was the \\\\\"sauvignon blanc\\\\\" flight but good to know for next time...\\\\n\\\\nThe clear winner of the night was definitely my roommate's spanish reds flight. She was obsessed and I definitely look forward to trying that one out next time! \\\\n\\\\nEven though I live in Penn Quarter, I never felt the urge to go into Flight because of the blacked out windows.

And then on top of that, she wouldn't mix her soda water with the vodka so she kept bringing her vodka in one glass, ice cubes in another and then soda water in another. At one point, we noticed that she had 6 glasses. I've never seen anything like this. I understand that this place is a wine bar but she also didn't seem as if she knew what red wine is considered dry?

Don't get me wrong, I love Proof, but the bill can really add up sometimes, so it's nice to have a good, less expensive option nearby  Having said that, Flight is sort of an odd space; the curved bar with seats for 16 is interesting, with what appears to be a tree growing behind it, but the rest of it is a bit drab.   \\\\n\\\\nBut you're not really here for that are you?  You're here for the wine, and I'm here to tell you that it's worth the visit for their thoughtful and interesting selection.  Bored of Bordeaux?  Tired of Tempranillo?  Flight has unusual, inexpensive, and often overlooked grape varietals such a Serbian Prokupac, Hungarian Kekfrankos, and Georgian Rkatsiteli.  And since this is Flight, they of course serve flights of wine with choices such as the Ottoman Empire (whites from Greece, Slovenia, and Georgia) and Austro-Hungarian Empire (a mix of white and ros\\\\u00e9s from the aforementioned countries).  \\\\n\\\\nThe glassware is short and boxy, and pours are available in half and full pours.  No cocktails, but they offer liquor and four draft beers with another nine beers and ciders in bottles and cans, including Stillwater Stateside Saison and Evolution Lucky No. 7 Porter.
