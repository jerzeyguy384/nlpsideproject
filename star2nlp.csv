We go back 2 weeks later, really looking forward to tasting some new wines and other menu items. Well what a difference 2 weeks makes! We were sold on a limited edition Alexander Valley red wine. Then we were told there was only a 1/2 glass left, which was ok, except the glass was filled with sediment. We asked to replace it with another choice, no problem. Then my partner ordered the truffle mac & cheese. It was served cold. Not knowing if this was intentional, I asked the waitress - who then got the manager. She said she was going to put it back on the stove top but it came back reheated from the microwave - not the same experience. She served the dish with no utensils - when she came back to check in, she said ""oh, I guess you don't know how it is, you have no fork"". She never came back. She never apologized and never offered to even comp the wine. At $100 for 2 glasses of wine and 2 menu items, that would be the very least one would expect. We could not have been more disappointed, we will not be back and we will NOT recommend. I realize everyone and every restaurant has a bad day but our situation was handled by the restaurant manager and it was the worst experience. An apology for the mishaps would have gone a long way.

There was no sound, no subtitles.  We each got one of the wines, but neither were very good.  The popcorn was stale.  No chocolate.

In this case, unfortunately, it was not a pleasant experience. The only reason I am giving two stars rather than one is because the wine was decent. I did not have the food so I can't critique that, but I can certainly explain the horrible service we had. We came for a birthday party and mind you, there were maybe three or four other tables with people in the entire two floors of the restaurant. Our server's name was Teymour I believe and he not only took forever to take our orders (some people came later and tried to order a bottle and he said no at first because there was too many people trickling in one by one rather than at once and he can't keep taking one order after another...REALLY??), but also my friend and I asked him for a glass of water and even though the pitcher of the water was already on the table, he should have brought us brand new glasses from the bar. Instead, he found whatever empty glass that was on the table and filled it with the pitcher of water (someone else had used the glass and finished their water so he was too lazy and just took theirs rather than getting new ones...again, REALLY??). Then to top it off, he refused to give individual checks or let alone split one check for our group (he only wanted one method of payment)! Finally someone had to talk him into it and he agreed after arguing. There were many other things he did, but this was the experience that I gathered from the night. Others from our group had additional bad experiences with him and will probably write reviews too. Please hire nicer and more hospitable waiters next time.

First, we were told happy hour was only at the bar. This is somewhat common in bars, but on my previous visit happy hour wasn't limited so this wasn't a welcome change. Since Flight is basically one large room, it seems silly to distinguish the ""bar"" from a table 10 feet from the bar. The bar is somewhat horseshoe shaped, so if you're there with several friends it wouldn't be easy to chat while sitting there.

There was some hummus on the happy hour menu we tried to order. We said we realized we couldn't get the happy hour price since we weren't sitting at the bar, but would still like to purchase it. We were told we couldn't even order it, even if we paid a non-happy hour (i.e., higher) price. Being told at a restaurant that we couldn't order something on the menu was the weirdest part of the whole experience. To their credit, when we said this was ridiculous the manager did allow us to order it, but it took some persuasion.

The best thing about this place: design.  When you walk into a dim setting of a nice tasteful small bar and dining area, you think this will be a perfect exciting date night. 

But then you encounter staff with rudeness and lack of professionalism hard to find elsewhere (this does not apply to the hostess - she was a sweetheart and very helpful!).  We sat at the bar since all tables were taken.  Both bartenders could care less that we are there.  The one we interacted with the most showed that she is interested in spending with us exactly 2 seconds it takes to listen to our order and other 3 seconds to drop our check. 

To my question whether they serve different flights - the name kind of suggests it, no? - she shrugged her shoulders and said there was one flight special on the menu and yes, it is a wine bar. I felt like an idiot. I asked then why did they call it Flight?  She responded - because you can order any combination of 3 wines from the list as a flight.  I am sorry, it is not at all OBVIOUS and doesn't say so on the menu. 

Also, don't expect any recommendations, since they don't seem to know the wines they are selling.  All night I could hear only - yes, that's nice or yep, great choice or try this one, its popular.

I entered Flight on Friday evening (Valentine's Day) around 5:35 as my boyfriend and I had 5:45 reservations. I walked in, circumnavigated my way around the path of entry and saw a man standing next to podium(which I couldn't see as the entryway acts as a bit of a small maze. As I approach and begin speaking to the man(who I later realize is one of the owners) he wags his finger in my face, says uh-uh, come around and I then see a young lady standing at the actual podium. Rule number one, if you don't want someone to mistake you for a host, then you don't stand at the podium.  The young lady at the podium was super nice and promptly placed me at a nice table to wait for my boyfriend. He arrived pretty quickly after me. Our server came over pretty quickly and gave us menus, but that is where the quick ended. After that, service was like pulling teeth. We even had a server change halfway through, to no avail. 

As for the foodstuffs, we were impressed with their extensive wine list but struggled through the happy hour red that our server could only describe as juicy. It was on the lower end of a so-so wine, which was confusing to me as this is a WINE bar!! The olives were warm and there was a spice we couldn't place crumbled on top. Bread basket was an interesting mix as there was cornbread that was slightly dry, a savory bread which may have been perfect with butter, but the butter was too cold to spread,  and a molasses bread that was the tastiest. Please note we did not even stay for dinner as just the one glass of wine and 3 apps took over an hour to receive. I may go back, but all serving kinks will need to be ironed out.

A reservation...for happy hour?  I decided to give them a second chance at a first impression, and I was again somewhat disappointed.  Serving wine in a low ball glass isn't avant-garde; it's kitschy.  If they want to use smaller glasses because of the tasting flights, then they should consider ISO glasses which are meant for exactly that. I would have expected more form a place where the owners/managers are supposedly accredited Somms.  For me, visiting a wine bar isn't just about drinking wine.  I expect the full experience of enjoying wine - the smell, the look, the taste. The low lighting makes it impossible to discern almost anything other than the difference between white and red. The choice of (lack of) stem ware gives no impression of aroma.  To their credit, they do offer some wines that you don't usually see, selections from less known regions and varietals.  The flights are arranged in interesting combinations, giving an opportunity for exploring something new or a twist on the familiar.  The one saving grace for Flight is the food.  Much credit goes to the chef for an amazing offering of small and entree plates.

2) By the time we received our pitcher of sangria we had not received our basket of bread, while the table next to us received their basket of bread immediately when they sat down before they had ordered anything.

Great Service - Although with half the group arrived late, the host managed to hold our reservation despite quoted 2 hrs wait. Service was on point  - constant refill on bread and water, dishes were served in a steady stream, clean plates were swapped through multiple courses. In addition, I brought in an outside birthday cake and the host offered to store it for us in the fridge right upon my entering and to present it at the end of the dinner with no cutting fee! 

Not So Great Food - Our waitress recommended $35 pp (12-16 dishes) to be shared among our large group. What we thought was a great deal turned out to be a total rip off. We received 12 different dishes that came in 2 servings each. After calculation, we noticed that we would had been better off ordering straight from the menu - total saving of more than $100 (we were given approximately 5 ppl worth of food). In addition, the food was just overall mediocre. The only above average dishes were the ham + chicken croquettes and truffle bikini. The worst dishes were chickpea spinach (mushy and bland) and hanger steaks (tough and stone cold).  We also ordered two persons game paella to share where all of us found it to be inedible - way too much salt and drenched in olive oil.

The Worst Tummy ache - my husband and I returned home that night with signs and symptoms of food poisoning. Later we learned that majority of the group also got sick later that night.  

Yes the service was great and ambiance was beautiful + perfect for large group. But there are way too many tapas restaurants in the area with much better price, tastier food, and no tummy-troublesome aftermath.

When I called I asked if there was anyway I could pre-pay for a bottle of sparkling wine (2008 Gramona) to be on the table when we arrived so we could toast my friends recent graduation from nursing school. I was told that they couldn't take a CC payment over the phone (probably for security reasons which in today's world I totally get) but he would make a note of it in the reservation for it to be on the table. Perfect! 
Called two days ahead of time to just confirm the reservation and to make sure that bottle would be on the table ready to go as soon as the honoree got there. I was told it would be ""chilled and all ready to go"". Hooray, can't wait! 
Saturday the 4/29 comes, we arrive right on time and we are sat but no sparking in sight. No worries though, we are still waiting on 2 more and it's busy so it's cool. We mention it the to server if we could get that bottle now just so the two of us can have a little. He says sure but a different server comes with beer glasses and sparkling WATER. Eh just a communication error no big deal. 
My other guests arrive and the bottle is opened a little after they are seated. Not as I had hoped but it's a celebratory night so I pay no mind. 
We get around 10 plates in total, the potato tortilla and the mushroom risotto were hits, everything else was good but not amazing. No one asked us how the food was. Just one check back to see if we wanted another bottle or some cocktails. Maybe they thought someone had already checked in on us or saw we were chatting a lot and didn't want to interrupt. Fair enough. 
After having our plates and glasses sit empty for about 15 minutes we were finally cleared. It's a Saturday night though they are busy so I'm not upset. 
Here's when I got really annoyed. Without any offer of dessert or wanting if we want more we are dropped our check. We all say in unison ""uh.... we kinda wanted to see a dessert list."" to the response of a curt ""sure"".  We browse the dessert list for about a minute until we are abruptly asked ""do you know what you guys want?"" kind of taken aback we ask about the sorbets, server seemed annoyed and said he'd have to check. After returning we decide on the sorbet. 
I ask the server to make sure the bottle of sparkling is on a separate tab than the rest of the bill since I originally wanted to take care of the separately. He must have been unclear since he proceeds to bring another bottle of the same sparkling to the table to open it. We stop him before trying to explain it again. He still seems confused since he asks ""you just want a single glass?"". Finally I explain it again and he says he will explain it to the other server who started us (who we really liked!). The original server seemed to understand it. 
All in all I was very disappointed. It was one bad step after another. I tried to be patient since it was a busy night. But every restaurant in the city is busy on a Saturday night so one can only leave so satisfied knowing there are hundreds of other restaurants within a 5 mile radius and 30 within 3 blocks! This was supposed to be a really special night for my friend but I wish we went elsewhere. I tried to be understanding all night but I left feeling agitated and severely uncared for. There is a huge difference between service and hospitality. At a reach, this could be considered bare bones service, hospitality was not even in the ballpark.

816,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=jE3r2qH6ulA-HVWyRzcs1w,"I came here for brunch with some friends on a recent Saturday. We made a reservation for around 12, but it wasn't necessary; the place was nearly empty upon getting seated. Around 1:30 or so, it was definitely more crowded and louder.

Overall, I think our meal was only fine. There were definitely some misses (to be described later). Our waiter was helpful as we were pretty indecisive about what we wanted. He suggested 3-4 tapas per person or one main entree and one tapa paired together. For the three of us, we ordered 10 tapas. Each one came out as it was finished in the kitchen, and it was a good pace. The stand outs were both potato tapas and the hanger steak. The flavors were really good. On the other hand, we got a bread with ham dish that wasn't worth it at all, and the spinach chickpea cazuela, recommended by the waiter, was bland. I could only handle so many bites of it, because after a while, it became one-note. If you order it, I would only get one. It was more than enough for the three of us.

So, the misses... first, we ordered 10 tapas, but we only received 8. The kitchen had forgotten the other two! This meant I couldn't taste the sunchokes tapa - something I had never seen before and was very much looking forward to tasting. Second, the bread that comes out before the meal is just way too much! I hardly had any, but the large pieces fill you up, so you don't have much space for real food. I think they should just nix the free bread. It doesn't add anything positive to the meal. Third, I think it's a misnomer to say people should order 3-4 tapas per person. The portions are so large (which is great), that I think 2-3 tapas makes more sense. While we received 8 tapas, we really only finished 7 of them, and even that was a struggle. I guess you don't really know until you start ordering things.

Bottom line: I wasn't impressed by the food here at all. The atmosphere is young and cool (that's a positive), but so is like every other restaurant nearby. I don't see someone becoming a repeat customer at brunch time.

Boy did I fail in that regard.

First of all, she said the jamon serrano was the worst she's ever tasted. She said it tasted like the cheapest version you could buy in a grocery store in Spain. The package would cost one euro.

Next, we ordered ceviche. She was already suspicious because it's a south american dish, not Spanish. When it came, the $9.50 ceviche was in a tiny little glass cup and, dios mio, it was so awful. She took one bite and declared it was the worst ceviche she's ever had. It's normally her favorite dish. The fish was tasteless. Severely lacking in all the goodness you expect from ceviche. ""Ten dollars for this...shit?"" was her response. She said it was such a crime she was almost driven to tears.

So there you have it, I took a girl from Madrid to Barcelona and it almost made her cry.

The salmon and avocado toast was yummy, although not a Spanish dish either. The salad was good and got her approval, despite the olives tasting cheap.

My family and I had a reservation for a party of 8 for 8:30 PM and we didn't get seated for about 20 or 30 minutes.  What is a reservation for if not to get seated at a specific time so the rest of your night is not disrupted?

Anyway, now while I don't really like the Americanized tapas experience because I always leave much poorer and still hungry, our whole experience at Barcelona was terrible.  After being seated late, we had to wait another hour + to get our main dish, the paella.  Yes, paella takes a long time, but we watched the couple next to us be seated, order their paella, finish, and pay before we even received our.  I am pretty sure they forgot it, because by the time it arrived, the rice was mushy and they seafood was the consistency of jerky.  The manager was fully aware of this, but did nothing.

However, the food here is rather lackluster, especially compared to their more established competitor, Estadio, down the road. The croquettes, which crispy on the inside, contained dry chicken on the inside and was hardly memorable otherwise. The grilled asparagus with radishes, which the waitress recommended, was not remarkable either - though the radishes did add a nice touch of acidity to the dish, the ratio of radish to asparagus was unbalanced.

My friend and I then decided to try their desserts - she went for the warm chocolate hazelnut indulgence (basically a chocolate lava cake) and asked for the coconut ice cream to be substituted for vanilla.

I ordered the flan catalan, which did not meet expectations either - the flan was too thick, too sweet, and uninteresting. It was very one note, and I quickly got sick of it after a few bites.

However, the service was just TERRIBLE. We literally didn't see our server after he took our food order. We kept having to flag someone down for everything.

I dined out as part of a double date, celebrating the recent promotion my friend received.  The four of us work in the restaurant industry to some extent, including a certified sommelier, experienced bartenders, and professional servers at fine dining establishments.  Professional is the key descriptor here, because we were sorely disappointed with the quality of service we received during our visit Thursday night (12/19).

This isn't a write-up pertaining to the BOH staff--the food was excellent and the wine list was impressive.  We enjoyed three bottles of wine, several tapas, and a few desserts.  Each came out in good timing, and to our satisfaction with excellent flavor and presentation.  Kudos to the chef.

Unfortunately, the night was spoiled with bizarre, immature and overtly rude behavior from the management and service staff who were more interested in leaving (we dined later in the evening as most industry folks do) for the night than fulfilling their job description.  A total of five different servers and a dancing manager--I kid not, he shimmied his way up to our table to introduce himself and kept popping up, even from behind the partitioned sliding door, every ten minutes to ""check in"" on us--approached our table during the course of our stay. 

Our first server, Chelsea (I believe that was her name) seemed irritated by our interest in enjoying a third bottle of wine and disappeared without introducing us to the other servers that would be taking care of us.  Next, Matt and an unnamed server cajoled out loud behind our table, their plan to ""go and talk to these people.""  After engaging us in small talk, clearly a method to get us to leave, Matt mustered the bravado and asked to try some of the remaining  wine on the table.  Really?  I don't think it works that way.  We try your wine.  Remember?  The other male server made it apparent that he hasn't studied your wine selection.  He bent over our table to read out loud every fact about the vineyard printed on the label.  To make matters worse, Matt walked off without clearing his dirty wine glass which we had to remove ourselves. 

Despite their rush to push us out (we were one of two tables left) the server presented us with the wrong check, only to retrieve it from the table and return with the correct one.  I hope this experience was an anomaly, because future guests deserve better service than we experienced.  The FOH staff at Barcelona is a discernible example of the decline of professional service in fine dining.

If you are going in the evening, hopeful for dinner, this ordeal will require table hovering outside, tag teaming with a friend/date on the inside and one or two people strategically placed by the bar ready to grab the first stool that becomes available.   This task will occupy you for hours.

At 6 pm, the host said the wait for a table inside was 2.5 - 3 hours.  Few, if any restaurants, are worth that kind of wait.  Barcelona, for all its appeal, is not one of them.  To get a table outside, the host will tell you it is first come, first serve.  Here's the catch- you have to see it first, keep someone outside near the table and send someone inside to inform the host that you saw the table first and will take it.  A word of advice, the outdoor staff are sadly uninformed by the host and other randomly circulating manager-types of what the seating arrangements are.  They were telling customers to get on the wait list or, alternately, to grab the first seat they saw.  As in my case, I couldn't get past the crowd surrounding the host to tell him quick enough that I found a table.  We had already waited an hour.  The host, then had to de-seat us and gave us a glass of wine for the trouble.  That was nice, but ridiculous that this is how a restaurant organizes its customers.  There we were, huddled outside with other would-be customers strategizing about how to get a table, sympathizing with the poorly informed outdoor wait staff and guessing at the role of the manager-types circulating throughout and randomly striking up conversations with customers but not entering the fray of table-seating. 

Beyond the table seating fiasco which is what I will remember most about the evening, the staff were friendly and apologetic.

We started with Curry Cashews which didn't have much flavor beyond the cashews themselves. They tasted good as roasted nuts do, but would have liked more of a curry presence.

We also had sun choke apple soup...it was poured at the table over fruit which was cool to watch. Great presentation though the soup was a little tart for our tastes.

The Fried Cauliflower with Lemon, Tahini, Garlic & Mint, dish lost most of it's ""cauliflower-ness"" after the frying. (I'm all for fried and roasted vegetables but it's so easy to overcook them...) But it got a bit better with the tahini dipping sauce. (We had that on the side and normally it's poured over.)

The Crispy Fingerling Potatoes were also over-fried and had very little texture of the actual potato left. The sauce they were served with was a bit too mayonais-y for our tastes. (But to be fair I'm generally against mayonnaise so if you're not you may love it. [but to be extra fair, I have an extra stomach just for potatoes, so if you screw those up, in this case with the over-frying, it really knocks the whole affair down a notch.)

All around the food was a little too rich for us...a good rich dish is nice to have but everything we ordered had a richness about it and it was too much.

They were nice enough to accommodate our picky kid with a dish of plain pasta...but that was $12 which felt awfully pricy.

I'll just recap my second visit, which was as displeasing as my first:

It was early in the weekday lunch hour on a cold day.  The restaurant was almost empty.  Since we walked there in the cold, two of us had Starbucks coffee cups in our hands.  The hostess hassled us and acted like she was going to force us to turn over our ""outside beverages"" for her to ""hold"" before permitting us to enter into her empty restaurant.  It was only when I said to my party, let's just go somewhere else for lunch so that I can finish my coffee, that she relented with a frown.  While I understand the principle of her request, it was RIDICULOUS under the circumstances.

The presentation of our meals was nice, but it fell flat on flavor.  Our salad with avocado and grapefruit was not good.  Our shrimp burgers-oyyyyy-think McDonalds Filet-O-Fish on a STALE bun with banh mi toppings.

Dessert was OK.  

Service was slow, even though it was empty.  It took ten minutes from when our drinks arrived for the waiter to stop chatting over by the bar and take our food orders.  1.5 hours for lunch on a weekday.  Glad we weren't actually in a hurry.  Weekday lunch needs to move faster than that.

1606,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=BKLYhbFSm3BO0L_ZN4Kegg,"Maybe we made a mistake by booking a reservation on Sunday during Labor Day weekend. The crowd was light. The hostess didn't say a word while seating us. We waited 10 minutes before the server even approached the table. Little did we know that this was the shortest wait time. The server asked what type of water we wanted, did not take a drink order, then she left. Someone else poured our water and then we waited. 

Having already decided on our order prior to arriving, there was no need to look through the menu. We wanted a tasting menu with wine pairing and Proof had this. Finally, one of the other servers noticed that my wife and I were not looking at menus and had no drinks. He became our server. 

A 6 course tasting menu took 3 hours. It was so poorly paced that it became difficult to even enjoy the food when it arrived. When it did arrive, I couldn't help but eat it fast thinking that this would encourage the pace to quicken. I was wrong. My empty dish would sit there awaiting someone to remove it. My water glass would be refilled. Someone would eventually take away the dish. I would get re-silvered. I would wait. The sommelier would pour wine and tell me about a dish that I would be off in the distant future. Since there was no way of knowing how long it would take for the food to show up, I felt unable to drink wine as no one would come by while we waited to potentially pour more if needed. 

I remember the food being tasty and the pairing being OK but the excessive waiting really ruined the experience. For $135 per person, this should have been special. The server asked us about the pacing before the last course and we told him that is was really slow. They comped our drinks but the final course took even longer than the previous course. Normally the Chef presents the course. Not on the last course. Too bad as I wanted to tell him how much I was disappointed about the pacing. Hopefully he reads this.

I could tell this wasn't their normal service but they are capable of it. To make it worse, they sat us on a banquet that had a seam that was unavoidable. Sitting for 3 hours on banquet seam waiting for food is not enjoyable.

Always delicious and fast, you can order from a set menu of 5 or so items and it comes with a glass of wine or beverage of your choice. I've never been disappointed in this menu. Yesterday my friend had the shrimp burger and I had the garlic shrimp with cilantro and slaw over rice. Pretty yummy.  However, I ordered iced tea as my drink. It was the color of iced tea, but was the weakest, most flavorless black tea (I asked the server) I've ever had. I sent it back and opted for a glass of white wine. Delish. 

But here's the kicker: neither the restaurant nor the bar was crowded so my friend and I lingered, each ordering a cup of coffee. Hers came in a cup that had dried ""coffee splash"" still on the outside, and also dried spots of coffee on the inner rim. The server tried to say she must have ""splashed"" while serving it, clearly not wanting to get another cup and another silver French press of coffee, but she did. So cup 2 came and was fine. The coffee was fine, good even. It was a decent-sized mug of coffee, but the press wasn't left and we weren't offered refills. The bill came, and the coffees were $5 each. FIVE DOLLARS FOR A CUP OF COFFEE. Not a specialty drink. Not a Venti or a triple shot anything. Just a single, solitary cup of coffee. PROOF, if you're reading this, that is just not okay. My entire lunch, including a glass of wine, was $14, and you charge FIVE DOLLARS for a cup of coffee? I do not appreciate being nickeled and dimed by restaurants to this degree. Charge an extra dollar for your scallops or for your tenderloin, but do not try to meet your margins like this. It is offensive. IT IS COFFEE. ONE CUP, NO REFILL.

-Wife's scallops were all cooked to different doneness. Most were way overcooked.

-Flank steak was fairly flavorless and very tough. It was drowned in sauce that tasted like a mix of worcestershire and soy sauce.

From the service point of view I can't understand how a establishment such as PROOF do not reiterate this very basic standard with their staff.
The hostesses were simply unpleasant and not one single smile was given while asking to be seated. (yes I did have reservation) There were two of them and both were very unfriendly and didn't seem happy to be working at this place at all. The tall black girl was certainly the most unpleasant of all.
Then we proceed to order dinner and the server was superb the last. Well knowledgeable of wine and their cheeses. Triva certainly knows what customer service is.

His nose was so stuck up in the ceiling that looking at customers and paying attention to service probably were the least of his concern that night.

Went here for a dinner date with my boyfriend. We were very excited to try this place after hearing so many good things about it... Overall, we were unimpressed - rather steep prices for very small portions of just-OK food.

We came on a Sunday evening, when the restaurant was nearly empty. The server was attentive and the food came out pretty quickly.

For a starter, we shared the gnocchi - which were delicious.

I had the scallops entree - I'm a very light eater, but this portion was laughably small. In fact, I briefly considered sending it back (and should have, in retrospect). I got a plate of 5 smallish scallops (which were tender) and about 2 tbsp worth of wilted chard - which was inedibly salty. At first, I thought the chef had forgotten the cauliflower puree that was supposed to come with this dish. But then I realized that it was there after all - a tiny smear hidden under the 3 scallops, so thin that it got crusty and stuck to the warm plate, and had to be scraped off. The plate also contained about a teaspoon of fairly tasteless beet foam, and 3-4 hazelnuts chopped into small pieces. Also, my dish came out quickly but was barely lukewarm.

My boyfriend had the lamb chops - the portion was small but bigger than mine (thank god!) I tried a bite - the lamb was great, while the farro ragout was pretty oily.

Overall, we were left with a $150 check for a draft beer each, a shared appetizer, two very small entrees, and no dessert. I'm not new to fine-dining restaurants and have no problem with smaller entrees, but I expect them to be well-prepared, tasty, and still sized like an entree rather than an appetizer. I don't know if we came on a off night, the kitchen was already shutting down, etc....We both left hungry and drove to Pupatella immediately afterwards for an amazing, hot, delicious, filling pizza.

Okay fine, we can adjust. (but just a thought Proof, if you're going to market yourself such a high-end restaurant with innovative, cutting edge food and services, then update your website!)

I had read an article in the Express literally two days prior raving about this limencello dressing and drink that the Chef at Proof makes. I love limencello and can NEVER find it. I was pretty excited to find it on the chef's tasting menu online (but not on the chef's tasting in the restaurant) so I asked Matt about it and he just stares at me like I'm crazy.

The food at Proof is delicious both times that I've been. The service was great the first time, but over Labor Day weekend 2012, we had the worst experience we've ever had AND the manager did not seem to care at all. I am jealous of the people with the 4 and 5 start reviews and I wish I had that type of service when I was there. Unfortunately, my review looks just like everyone else in the 1 to 2 star category. It seems Proof has a habit of being stuck-up, having several misanthropic servers and staff and continuing to charge full price even when they could comp something small to keep your business. 

We came in, sat down and started looking at the drink menu. We had two guests from out of town. One of our guests wanted a cocktail with tequila, but there wasn't anything like that on the cocktail menu. She asked the server to have the bartender make something up for her, and he did. He brought it back, set it down, and did not bother to tell her what the drink was. We placed an appetizer order. The apps came, we ate them and then sat quietly with empty drinks, empty plates and no server in sight. It was not busy that night, so I'm not sure what the issue was -  everyone seemed to have left DC for Labor Day. After about 40 minutes, we flagged someone down. He happened to be a manager and he finally took our food order and an order for a second round of drinks. A few food runners brought out our entrees, but once they hit the table, no one ever checked on us to see how the meal was going. Again, like I said, the food was good, but there was no one around to refill drinks even.

Finally my husband went to the hostess stand to ask for a comment card and then everyone started to try and pay attention to us again. Our server finally made a second appearance to try and show us the dessert menu. We were full and disenchanted with Proof by this time, so we had to pass. The bill came, we settled it and on the way out, we explained to the manager how the evening went. He didn't seem to care and only said sorry. He had only apologetic words, not actions. He did nothing to remedy the awful service. He did not offer to buy us a round or comp anything on our bill. It was a very rainy night and it would have been logical to have us stay at the bar and buy a round, but they wanted us out.

Despite our attempts to engage our server and have him speak to us or interact with us, he was having non of it. He seemed to be a quiet, keep to himself kind of guy. Which it totally fine if you don't work in a service industry. We asked for specials, he had nothing and pointed us back to the menu. We asked for recommendations and he pointed us back to the menu. We didn't see him from the time we ordered appetizers until the time he came to try and peddle dessert. I am not sure if he had a major life crisis or something terrible going on, but a little communication would have gone a long way. Even if his manager had explained what was going on. No one at Proof that night seemed to care about fixing the issues or ensuring repeat business.

The food at Proof is great, but there is nothing else there worth a 4 or 5 star review. It is far too expensive, dark and pretentious to treat customers like they are at a casual dining restaurant. At least when you're at Chipotle, you know that you are in charge of getting your own fork, filling your own drink and busing your own table.

I was so disappointed by Proof and I'm sad that I'll probably never go back there again. A bad server is one thing, but an indignant manager is another. If they treat other people this way, i don't think they'll last long.

Proof is has the ambiance of a steak house with a pub, nothing fantastic but still really pretty. 

When I got there, the first thing I ordered was tea, well, I'm sick, so YEAH i'm going to order tea. 
STRIKE 1. The waitress gave me this face of ""You cheap B..""
We took a little while to order but finally agreed to start off with a lovely array of french cheeses, one cow, one sheep etc.. ""what do the cheeses come with? 
Which array of cheese comes with the fig?"" I asked, STRIKE 2. This waitress looks at me like I'm an alien. ""They come with nothing,"" she said. Nothing??? How can cheese come with nothing? I asked the waitress if she was sure, she said yes.
We ordered it anyway...

My friend and I ordered some wine, which made our waitress less snappy, we also ordered a bronzino and some gnocchi. 

When the cheese plate got to the table we were pleasantly surprised at the beautiful arrangement in front of us. 3 cheeses, honey, apple sauce, some amazing bread and dates. It was sooo good. we oooed and awed as we ate every last bite, but, alas, all good things must come to an end.

The main course arrived, the bronzino was burnt on one side which made the already small piece of fish even smaller.

My gnocchi were terrible. It was giant pieces of pumpkin gnocchi, (lazy gnocchi if you've read my Michy's review) that did not blend well with the sauce. I couldn't eat 3 bites, I ended up taking it home and throwing it away, and I NEVER throw away food.

My friend wanted dessert, so she got a cake, which was ok,
The worst part was the bill, it wasn't terribly expensive but the waitress had ordered me a large portion of gnocchi, without even asking my preference.

This is one of the saddest reviews I've ever written. I had been dying to go to Proof for ages but somehow was never able to work it out while I actually lived in DC. Thus, on a brief visit, I made it a priority to have lunch there. What a disappointment.

Amanda C., my lovely lunch date, was running a little late due to the trials of parking in DC so I let the hostess know that she was on her way for our 1:30pm reservation. Rather than giving me a menu or suggesting I wait at the bar, she just let me sit there but made sure to mention at least twice within 10 minutes that ""the kitchen would close"" by 2pm. As if I could do anything about it but wait. I eventually had to ask her if she wouldn't mind getting me a menu.

When Amanda arrived we ordered quickly. I initially tried to order the lunch crush but was told a bit brusquely that this is only available at the bar. That's absolutely fine, but they could have been a little nicer and also, why provide the lunch crush menu to patrons not seated at the bar then? Anyway, Amanda ordered a salad and I went for the butternut squash gnocchi.

The food, I have to say, was amazing. The gnocchi literally melts away under your tongue, yielding sweet and salty pockets of flavor. However, different servers kept coming by every few minutes to ask if we were done yet. Proof doesn't close to prepare for dinner until 3:30pm so I thought this was a bit odd and not a little irritating. When they asked Amanda how her food was and then actually tried to whisk away her plate as she lifted her fork to her mouth, I got a bit upset. When I counted a total of 4 attempts to take away our food in under 20 minutes, my lunch mood was ruined. 

I only hope that this experience was an outlier but since this is all I've got to go on, I'd say Proof has definitely not proven itself in my eyes.

But it was a BIG disappointment. Maybe it was an off night, that they had an off start. We did have an early dinner reservation at 6pm, since we were flying out early morning the next day.  But from the get go, nothing seemed to work right.

The waiter was not really attentive. He didn't bring us our bread to our table, until after we asked. Maybe it wasn't his responsibility, so bad bus boys.  But the service was slow.   Granted the pace of our meal was adequate, there was a pair sitting across of us who left the restaurant after waiting to be served. The poor waiter was shocked to not find his customers there and the bus boys just folded their napkins, placing them on the table, expecting them to return. I wanted to tell them, ""They aren't coming back"".

The food here was not as what people have reviewed.  The Waygu beef sashimi was not fatty enough, thus the reason why they drenched it in a yuzu type sauce. You'd expect it to melt in your mouth, but it was like eating regular beef carpaccio.  The sweet bread dish is outstanding though. But that is the only highlight of my meal.  The halibut was tasteless, as I could not taste the almond pesto that accompanied it.  And my boyfriends 5 spice Peking duck breast was least to desire for in tasty as it it was lacking.  What wasn't lacking were the sides that we ordered.  Both the crispy cauliflower (deep fried) and the grill wild ramps were too salty.   This meal was less to be desired and enjoyed.

As mentioned, I really wanted to like this restaurant, as I expected it to be highly celebrated from the reviews. But as always, the hype does not meet the actual reality and it falls flat in all ways: food, taste, and service.

It was more child- unfriendly than traveling in Europe where a kids menu is not even contemplated as an option and there is not a crayon or other ""activity"".  

So, while I understand that children may not be a key demographic for this establishment,  the level of the unfriendly attitude made it a very disappointing experience.  Our experience was that children must order off the regular menu -- for an adult portion at adult prices and the modifications requested may not necessarily be made.  I asked to have rice added and got a ""the chef does not like to change dishes"" -- My thought was that there was rice on the menu, I did not ask to have the chef cook rice just for us and that it would be easy to add some on to an entree that was on the menu.  We were there early (5:30pm), not in the middle of the dinner rush and were the first ones in the restaurant, I did not expect this request to be so burdensome.  

We have been to fine dining restaurants in DC, and many other cities in the US as well as overseas and I have never found a restaurant where they refused to consider a half portion for a child, much less making it something they would eat.  I requested no sauce and received a meal that although it had no sauce, included vegetables that had pepper flakes on them.  I don't know many preschoolers that eat anything with pepper flakes.   

Other than this unfriendly child experience, the wine and beer offerings are extraordinary and our meal was excellent.  The service was disinterested at best and despite the fact that the meal and the menu were really top notch, if the Chef and the restaurant management are so inflexible as to not accommodate on a child's portion, I am going to visit another restaurant in the Penn Quarter -- and there are many other good ones.

Each time I have patronized Proof, I have gone for drinks at the bar. What I noticed only a few days ago, was the high number of varietals that are quite unique (that's a great thing as far as wine bars go). However, the bartender quickly and in a rather short and snobby tone informed me that it was company policy not to allow complimentary tastes of their wine. When I asked, how I was to know that I would like it, if I was unfamiliar with it, she explained that they simply describe it to me. 

As a frequent patron of wine bars, this policy is the first that I have ever heard. Most wine bars, realize that customers are there to explore and will offer a small taste to be sure that you will enjoy the glass and it also helps to ensure you aren't wasting money. So, I ended up purchasing two 2 oz pours, that tasted nothing like how they were described, and were not enjoyable. 

While the appetizers I had were quite tasty- tuna tartare, a selection of cheeses and the vegetable tempura; I would give second thought to going there again because of the tone in which the bartender communicated and the fact that the policy even exists.

The last time I went to Proof was the summer of 2011.  My plan was to join a friend for a late lunch and some wine on a Friday afternoon.  Our plan was to arrive around 2:00 pm after their lunch rush was complete.  I requested a table for two on their very empty patio and was told by their hostess that I would have to wait for my second party to arrive.  Throughout undergrad, I worked in service industry and therefore, understand this policy in general.  During busy times, management wants to ensure that the whole party will show up.  But the patio literally had not another soul on it.  Not only that, what if the party was just me, would they not seat me then? I thought holding to a policy under the circumstances was just ridiculous.  My friend eventually arrived and we enjoyed wine and some great cheese.  However, our server continually rushed us.  We wanted to linger and would probably have spent significantly more time and money had he not continually dropped the ""hint"" that he wanted to close out and also, that their dinner rush was going to be starting soon and he wanted the table for dinner guests.  I was really blown away by that because 1) Proof doesn't reserve the patio because of variable weather and 2) the server didn't know if we wanted to stay for dinner as he didn't inquire.  

I took the time to bring this up with the manager saying that the server was very polite but made some really bad assumptions about my friend and my intentions.  I also commented on the policy of not seating a party if they are not complete and the idea that they may want to ""bend"" that policy when circumstances warranted. The manager was polite in that he listened but other than that, nothing was done.   I believe its only fair that the people who can possibly do something about the problems be notified and have an opportunity to remedy the situation before airing the issue publicly.  Therefore, as a final follow up, I wrote a long letter to the owner and general manager of the restaurant describing my last experience and the other times at I had been treated rudely at Proof.  Not a peep from either one of them.  So, here I am to tell you, go somewhere else.

For appetizer I ordered the Miso Glazed Sablefish stir fried soba noodles, zucchini. The fish was cooked well and stood on its own, the stir fried noodles ruined the effect, too greasy and bland...I could have bought it from the local Chinese restaurant. My sisters had the Roasted Chicken Breast, the meat was tough and had no flavoring. 
All in all, this place is not worth a second visit.

2391,Sonoma Restaurant & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=QGhdshgqSxzpcplLpOFHCA,"The low star rating is primarily because of the service. We had a large group, granted, but the restaurant was pretty empty for brunch on Sunday, so it seemed like they should be able to handle us. We all got the bottomless brunch for $35. Instead, the waiter told us we wouldn't be ordering anything and that he'd send out one of everything for us to try-- it would be easier for the kitchen. Fine, if that's what he was going to do, it sounded good to have a chance to try lots of different dishes. 

That is not what happened. I think he and kitchen got together and decided they'd only send out what THEY wanted, not what we wanted. For example, they sent out something like 10 plates of the oyster hash. Only one or two people at the table wanted to eat it, so it was a bit of a waste. We tried to eat some of them to be polite, but several plates remained untouched. We really wanted steak and eggs, but that came out at the very end when we were all pretty full, and only one round of it, which was disappointing. They tried to fill us up on potatoes and eggs, it seemed--we got a lot of fried and poached eggs, as well as omelettes, and potatoes to accompany many dishes (including one giant bowl of potatoes on its own). I don't know why it would have been so terrible for us to simply place our orders. The way they brought everything out, a lot of food was wasted. 

We did request bacon many times-- so simple!-- but we had to keep asking to get them to bring it out to us. With 15 or so people, even a big plate of it meant each person only got one piece at a time. 

As for the food itself, most of it was generally fine. The butter lettuce salad was pretty decent thought rather overdressed and could have used more avocado. The bacon had good flavor (not overly salty). The steak, when it finally arrived, was pink and juicy. The fried potatoes were crisp and yummy (it looked like they sliced fingerling potatoes). I'm not huge on french toast but the nutella one wasn't bad. The donut holes were cold, unfortunately. The sausage was nothing to write home about. 

As for the mimosas, the waiter was very unclear as to when we were being cut off or reaching our two hour limit, so many in the party believed at the end we had one more round coming. I think the decent thing to do is to let people know-- since that's a lot of the cost of bottomless brunch-- when you're stopping the pours. We had to argue for a while before finally getting a final round of half-pours for everyone.

As for me, I don't drink, so I wish more places would accommodate that, either with a discount on the bottomless brunch or at leas with more interesting or creative non-alcoholic drink options. Instead, I just got orange juice. Meh. 

Our waiter at the end had the nerve to tell us he thought he did a great job. What the heck?

The food was not bad, but it was not memorable and did not capture the vibrancy of flavors that are found in Northern California (not sure if they were even going for that, or if this place is just Californian-in-name-only).   

The octopus appetizer wasn't bad, but like the main course, it was served warm but not hot.  The entrees were way too small to be called a main course.  I was shocked to be served a sirloin steak that couldn't have been larger than 4oz.   In looking at other reviews, it seems that small portions are standard here, and my tiny steak was priced costs $25.  It was cooked perfectly, but was not particularly tender and by no means was worth the regular menu price.  

Desserts were a pleasant surprise.  The chocolate chip bread pudding and semolina cake with blood orange gelato were off the charts delicious, and I would definitely come back and sit at the bar and have a dessert with a glass of wine.  They also were surprisingly large given the size of the other courses.

We waited a few minutes at the host stand, when a woman who had been sitting at the bar walked to the hostess stand and, without acknowledging us, opened the drawer at the host stand, took out her cell phone, and went back to the bar. She played with her cell phone for a bit, then looked back at us, still standing at the host stand, and asked us, ""Have you been helped?"" Uhhh... No. She seated us.

The service was just terrible. And there really was no reason for this, as there were only four tables occupied.

For starters, the organization of the wine list is a bit confusing.  It was hard to read between the wines and figure out the varietal/grape.   

Then, as your gaze moves to right, you see the $/glass and you realize that you better be willing to drop a ton of money here.  There are very few wines under $10/glass.  Many wines are priced above $15/glass.  And, since I couldn't really find a wine I enjoyed, I spent a lot of money on wine I really didn't like.

The potatoes I then ended up ordering as a side to complement this sad excuse for a entree were bland and tasteless as well, except for the pepper I ended up burying them in.
To summarize, the service was slow, the food was lousy, and the portions were a joke.

I saw an older lady dropping ice from her water into her white wine; time to be worried.  White wine temp, by the bottle, which I ordered was barely cellar temperature ~60f.  The provided cooler had whole ice with no water and thus totally ineffective as a chiller, as you couldn't get the wine in contact with the ice.

*Grilled sardines failed to be grilled, but the stewed tomatoes were tasty
*Red Beans were luscious and had a good flavor as if cooked with a rind of Parmeasan
*Arugula salad, the kitchen subbed gouda for ashed, fresh goat cheese and failed to include the radiccio - meh

As a drink and appetizer spot, Sonoma has it down, with an interesting and tasty selection of cheeses from across the country and lots of other small plates to choose from. Their wine list is vast, and it's amusing to watch it poured from a tap, drawing the liquid from individual bottles in the case that lines the bar. 

But as a dinner destination, I'm unimpressed with the average-tasting entrees they turn out at this fancy and expensive restaurant. 

My friend and I ate at the bar on a Thursday night. We had a three-cheese platter ($15), with Rouge River blue cheese, served with apple preserves; Appalachian cow cheese, served with raisin compote; and the Pipe Dreams chevre, served with date chutney. All three cheeses were scrumptious and fun to eat.

For entrees, I ordered the lemon orechiette with artichokes and clams, which tasted like an Olive Garden dish, which is fine, but it didn't come with free salad, breadsticks and a mint ;-) The flavor didn't strike me and the noodles were white and soft and tasted all-too processed. 

My friend had the papperdelle duck ragu, which was equally just alright. The waiter had explained the noodles as ""like penne, just bigger,"" but they were flat and long like lasagna noodles, all smashed down like the last of a casserole. 

The bartender was nice and served us quickly, so we let the misadvise about the noodles' likeness to penne slide. 

Our good service was slightly overshadowed by the fact that two women interrupted our meal to inquire about a barstool next to ours that had a coat and purse on it. When the woman saving the stool for a friend filled them in, they proceeded to pull the one on the other side of us out into the middle of the room, racking it loudly across the floor. Not even two minutes later, a waitress began the exact same routine, harshly asking about the stool and then dragging the other one back in place with the same nails-on-a-chalkboard sound. 

The restaurant itself is excessively loud for the amount of people. So much so that if you're sitting at a table, it's oftentimes difficult to hear the persona across, which is especially off-putting since it's supposed be a relaxing, laid-back kind of place. 

Alas, Sonoma has a pretty storefront and brings a little class to that Pennsylvania Ave. block of stinky intern bars, so the bad acoustics and marginal food aren't enough to make me hate the place. And despite my qualms, it seems to be rather popular. Maybe it's just a wine-o thing...

My boyfriend and I went there on Saturday, and overall, I felt it was only an adequate dining experience, with an overpriced menu that was trying a little too hard.

We started with the pan-seared scallops and the mortadella chacuterie plate.  The scallops were good, but the white beans and the eggplant puree didn't seem to compliment the dish, and honestly the texture of the beans mixed with everything else was strange.  That mortadella was fine, nothing special.

I ordered pappardelle duck ragu, which I thought would be delicious, but it wasn't good at all.  The duck, which I usually really like, was super tough and well done, and there wasn't much of a ""ragu"" at all, just chunks of meat over giant noodles.  I actually got a little bit nauseous halfway through the meal.  My boyfriend ordered the local pork, and the joke of the evening was the amount of collective white beans in his dish and our scallop appetizer.  So many white beans.  It was a little odd.

The decor was fine, although we were seated at possibly the worst table ever (right under the stairs), and super close to another table.  It wasn't crowded, they could have easily seated us in a more desirable location.

The food was EXPENSIVE, for what it was, at least.  I don't usually cringe when I get a bill, but I honestly did not feel like the meal was worth as much as they charged us.

Scallops - This was the highlight of the meal for me.  Two perfectly cooked scallops with sweet endive and some swiss chard in a rich broth.  Very delicious and highly recommended.  

Mussels - These were good, but a little strange.  The broth was thick, which threw me off.  It had the consistency of cream of potato soup.  The flavors were there but I got a little hung up on the consistency of the broth to really enjoy it.  

Pizza Verde - This was a pretty simple pizza with pesto and goat cheese.  Pretty hard to screw this up, but it didn't really do much for me.  Crust got floppy pretty quickly.  

Wahoo - This was a special the night we were there.  It came grilled over some kale with roasted parsnips on the side.  It sounded right up my alley, but it would disappoint.  The fish was over cooked, the kale was too lemoney, almost sour.  The parsnips were hard.  Overall, a poor effort on what could have been a fantastic dish.

The risotto was probably my favorite, but Erin wasn't really a fan of that. The pacing between courses seemed a bit off either taking too long or arriving to quickly.

The experience was slightly awkward as well. We showed up and had to sit right by the entrance which was cold and every time the door opened the wind blew on us. There were other tables open, but they said since we had made later reservations, they had to save the tables. Erin put on first her winter coat, soon followed by her winter hat. About 15 minutes into the meal they said they had a table open and moved us further from the door where it was warmer and much more pleasant. Which was nice, but like I said slightly awkward.

2665,Sonoma Restaurant & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=PRnAoOWrTi2v-TgL_kYuIg,"There a few reasons why this place sucked, but I'll start with its positives.

1.The space is very pretty and has a great atmosphere.  If you ignore the ceiling tiles that remind you of friends' basements across the country, everything else looked great.

2. I would come here to hang out at the bar and get some wine with friends.  The bar is large and seems like it could be fun.  The crowd seemed young, well dressed and attractive.  The coat rack limits the space a bit though.

Now onto what sucked.

1. The food.  I actually think the menu is reasonably priced.   However for those prices, I still expect great food.  I'm all about earthy, simple food, but this menu had fairly interesting ingredients with little to no ambition with them.   My pork chop was the toughest piece of meat Ive had in years and my friend's was no different.  It also wasn't particularly tasty.  The polenta with it was runny and kind of nasty.  Their soup of the day (sweet potato and shrimp bisque) tasted nothing like sweet potatoes, was too spicy and was horribly seasoned.  The cheeses: I've bought much better at Whole Foods.  The wild boar ragu was ok, but nothing notable.  

2.  The service.  Our waiter was smug and not particularly good at his job.  He was rather haughty when we ordered a less expensive bottle of wine.  He neglected to refill our water for the entire meal.  He also forgot the two accompaniments that we ordered with our cheeses.  I also asked him to pick out 6 cheeses that would include 2 hard cheeses (like a cheddar or parm), 2 blues and 2 goat's milk.  We wound up with 1 blue, 1 goat and 4 hard cheeses.  Almost all of which were sharp.  It was difficult to believe this was a ""sampler.""

3. The Wine List.  While they have some nice wines here, I expect a place that dubs themselves a wine bar to have a wider variety.  The price points start at $45 for the cheapest bottle. (I think).  It also quickly moves up to around a $79+ price point on the following page.   Anyone with a decent knowledge of wines knows that there are some fantastic cheap bottles, especially from SONOMA.   The markup was a bit high for my taste as our $18 choice was priced at $50.  

4. The Layout.  They have two monster tables toward the back that appear to screw over smaller parties.  I couldn't get a 7:30PM (and had to settle for 6:30) reservation, even though the place was empty when we got there.

5. 0 (zero) out of 4 people enjoyed their meal.

We started our meal out with the Pate Campagne and the Pork Rillettes. While I loved the pate--a beautiful blend of pork and pistachios, light on the pistachios (just the way I like it)--the Pork Rillettes was a bit on the bland side, although the nicely-done house mustard did a decent job of enhancing the flavor. That said, I would prefer to spend my money on a charcuterie dish that stands on its own and does not require a condiment.

For entrees, we split the Fettuccine with Lamb Stew and the Braised Beef Ravioli. The lamb on the fettuccine was very good and had a nice mixture of spices and gaminess to it that complimented the pasta. I did wonder about the fettuccine itself, though--although the menu claims it is house-made, the texture seemed like it had been house-made, dried out, and re-boiled; the pasta was definitely not on par with the noodles at Dino, Ala Lucia, or Birch and Barley, all of which are in a comparable price range. We loved the ravioli though--the beef was perfectly seasoned, the sweetness in the marmalade complimented the savoriness of the beef well, and the potatoes added a nice bit of texture.

As far as dessert went, we had the donut-like dish filled with apple jam (don't recall the name) and the chocolate-dipped olive oil cake. The cake was something different and outstanding, a nice and moist but not-too-sweet piece of white cake dipped in rich, dark chocolate. The donuts were a bit of a disappointment, though--the apple ""jam"" was more like applesauce that tasted the same as apple sauce out of a bottle, and the donuts themselves were served at room temperature. With the new fad of freshly-made fried dough dishes in restaurants, I'd expect a dessert that competed better.

The real disappointment at Sonoma, however, was the service. We arrived at the restaurant early, and it was never terribly busy. That being the case, we expected some degree of attentiveness from the servers. In the end, however, that wasn't the case. We often finished more than half our dishes before anyone asked how they were--they never even asked about our entrees--and our question regarding the identity of the pickled vegetables on the charcuterie plate went unanswered despite the fact that we asked two different servers, both of whom promised to check with the kitchen. On the positive side, though, our servers did (when they were around) provide some great recommendations for dishes.

2760,The Pursuit Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=FCamB-BNzLIMck_fOT1CxQ,"I'm giving this place two stars (probably more like two and a half) for a few reasons. 

1. Service. We came here for brunch one Sunday and our waiter was pleasant but the service was so slow. We ended up spending multiple hours over a small, no-frills brunch that didn't need to last quite as long as it did. It was nice being there but we all got to point where we were ready to go and wanted to leave. 

2. Portions. I can understand smaller portions and sometimes even enjoy a light meal. The real problem I had here was the portion size combined with the price. Their brunch menu definitely isn't cheap but you don't get much food. When there are so many places in D.C. to have a hearty brunch, this place doesn't compete well. 

I've heard they have good wine and that it's a good place to go for HH. Perhaps I will go and try it again one night after work, but the brunch experience I had here was pretty lackluster.

I think this is the only time in my life that I've ever eaten just six french fries at a time.

The meal itself would be in the 3 star range were it not for the extremely slow service. It took us a solid 20 minutes to get water (which we ran out of several times), and each phase after moved at a similar pace, which was particularly frustrating given the importance of refills in the context of bottomless mimosas.

We were seated upstairs and had very attentive service at the beginning of the evening.  We made note that it was our friend's birthday and commented on the desserts to the waitress.

At some point half way through the evening, our initial server left and we were turned over to the bartender.  We were unaware that this had happened, but went for a very long time without anyone checking on us (or refilling our wine that was being kept on ice somewhere else).  When the bartender finally stopped by and we tried to order the birthday cake, we were told that the kitchen was closed.  And it was obvious from the curtness in the woman's voice that she was not happy to be serving us.  I understand that that kitchen has to close at some point, but we had talked about the birthday with our previous server and hadn't been alerted that the kitchen was closing or checked on to see if we wanted/needed anything else.

If you scroll through the reviews, you'll find they're all either really good or really bad; no middle-of-the road ratings. And in the bad reviews, the issues are almost always service-related. That's generally indicative of bad training, a management issue. This place is quite possibly a gem, but a few poor performing servers are sending customers away with a bad taste in their mouths. That's exactly what happened to my group on my recent visit. 

I, along with a group of six, made the trip here from the Atlas Performing Arts Center after having enjoyed a Friday night show. We arrived right before 10 and the place was packed. Downstairs seating, full; upstairs seating, full; bar area, full. But wait, there was a light at the end of the tunnel...

No, literally, there was bright light beckoning at the back of the restaurant. We walked pass the bar, pass the kitchen area, and toward the light to find a mostly empty patio area. There was one other large group, but they were more than happy to share the area. This find would be the highlight of the evening.

10:05- seated and ready 
10:15- server comes and passes out menus, checks on other table, runs off
10:22- server returns with 6 glasses of water (I guess a couple of us were to share), drops them and runs off. Btw it's been nearly 20 minutes and this is a wine bar, are we gonna get around to taking a drink order anytime soon.
10:24- server is ready to take our drink orders, but since we'd been waiting forever, we had long decided what we wanted to eat, and simply ordered everything.
10:26- A new acquaintance to my right calls a friend who lives nearby to join us.
10:37- The friend shows up, having walked three blocks to get there, beer in hand (Apparently he had been here before, and knew to order from the bar).
10:38- Frustrated, two of the people at our table finally get up to grab a couple of bottles of wine from the bar.
10:39- Drinks arrive. Food comes out in spurts and starts shortly thereafter.

Thirty-five minutes from the time we sat down 'til the time we first got drinks...'nuff said. 

I really, really wanted to give this place one-star. But the caprese salad was tasty and the old-fashioneds were damn good. Plus, from the patio, we could hear the music from the club next door (if you're not into hip-hop, avoid the patio at night), so it wasn't all bad.

They have a great selection of international wines and the food (enormous charcuterie board, gourmet grilled cheeses) was outstanding, but man, the service was a turn-off.  From the moment we sat down at the bar, I could tell that the previous reviews I'd read about the frosty bartender were true.  We each got a couple of wine flights, and I chose to try their red blend flight (the one that's supposed to highlight customer favorites and good wines).  One of the wines was terrible -- I thought so, my girlfriends thought so, the woman sitting near us who had the same flight thought so.  It just tasted off -- like the bottle was bad or something.  I mention this to the bartender when she came back to see how we were doing (which was few and far between -- she only refilled our waters after I had to ask twice) to see if I can try another taste of the same wine out of a different/new bottle or try something else, and she informs me that this is one of their most popular wines, they open multiple bottles of it in a night, clearly I am mistaken and and ""you just don't like it"".  I have never, ever been told that by a bartender/server in my life.  I was pretty taken aback by her attitude, and so were my friends.  She may have been frustrated by the fact that the place was pretty busy and she was the only person serving at the bar or at the few tables, but geez.  Don't snap at your customers.

Our plan was to enjoy our flights with appetizers then go upstairs to the restaurant seating for dinner and more wine.  When we arrived at 5:45 were were seated at ""the ledge"" because the bar couldn't accommodate our party of 4.  This place is really tiny.  The ledge is a shelf facing the wall with 4 stools which makes conversation with anyone but the person sitting next to you extremely difficult. The flights deals aren't available in the upstairs dining room (which wasn't open at that time anyway).  The flight menu was only available by going to the bar and reading off the chalkboard.  Of the 7 red wines available for tasting, 2 were sold out for tasting with no other choices.  We waited 40 minutes for our flights to be delivered to our party and not once did a server check on us or offer a status of our order.  The bar patrons were being very well taken care of in the meantime.  There was no explanation of the wines.  The labels weren't shared with us so we have no idea what brand of wine we were drinking.  The bar staff was dismissive as we sat in our forgotten corner next to the open kitchen.

We ordered 2 appetizers:  the blue cheese & bacon deviled eggs (delish) and the hummus & naan bread.  They didn't have hummus so we ordered bruschetta, which was very good.  I would have given my experience one star, but the appetizers were very tasty.

Our party eventually got our wine flights and appetizers but they didn't bring any napkins.  One member of our party had to go to the bar to ask for napkins.  After 10 minutes and a trip to the basement, a bartender pulled generic dollar store paper napkins out of the package and handed them to us  (the bar patrons had cloth napkins).  The server never came back and we had to go to the bar to ask for our check.  Our party decided to close out our bill and go elsewhere for dinner.

This was an extremely disappointing experience.  If Pursuit Wine Bar is offering Groupon deals to get folks into their restaurant, they made no effort to get us to come back and pay full price for anything.  We were treated like 2nd class all the way.  

I will definitely not go back.  If you're looking for a fun place with good food in that neighborhood, try Argonaut a few doors down.  We had really good food and exceptional service.

1. The bartender did not seem to know the wine or cocktail lists. I told him the name of the cocktail I wanted twice, and then had to point to it on the menu, like I was a child at Denny's. My friend had to do the same with the wine she asked for. The bartender explained that this was only his second week. He should know the menu on day one. 

2. The Sangrias were terrible. I appreciate the attempt at ""grown up"" Sangria, or whatever they are going for, but every Sangria recipe includes at least some sweetness. The Vinoteca versions (red wine and Rose) were bitter and tasted like wine with some raw fruit on top. Not good.

3. I only ordered one appetizer, so maybe I just chose poorly. But the Beets With Romesco was a very basic, boring dish. 

4. This is a wine bar, so I expected some atmosphere. The lighting was fine, but the music was some random rock station from Spotify. Try some jazz maybe? And why have a TV in a prime spot, and why show NBA basketball on it? I love watching sports on TV, but not at a wine bar.

I went for the Saturday Brunch and our group was seated outdoors. At no point did we have our own waiter, so we had to get up and order food or drinks from the bar. The bartender would periodically come down and check on us, or refill the pitchers of ice water. 

Probably ten or fifteen minutes after ordering my drink, I saw groups of people leaving the outdoor bar with drinks. Once I stood at the bar and waited, the bartender made my drink. 

The food came out in a reasonable amount of time, but they didn't bring utensils. The guy next to me even asked for utensils... After a couple minutes I went inside and grabbed some off of the counter. Once I got back, some other people went and grabbed utensils too. That's not even a basic level of service... Completely unacceptable.

My duck eggs Benedict was delicious, but there's no way I'll go back. There are a lot of other places with delicious food that can also provide a minimum level of service.

Came here for Restaurant week with my date.  We ordered the sweet potato fries and salad w/ goat cheese for apps, duck breast and hake for entrees, and chocolate flight and creme fraiche ice cream for dessert.

Sweet Potato Fries: Very good; came with homemade ketchup. Nothing too extraordinary.
Salad w/ Goat Cheese: also very good, but nothing extraordinary.
Duck Breast: Date said it was done perfectly and very well-seasoned (nice and rare)
Hake: Amazing. Flavor was amazing and it was cooked perfectly. It was a daily special, but they should definitely have this on their main menu.
Chocolate Flight: Nothing special; 6 truffles of 3 different varieties. They were very tasty though.
Creme Fraiche Ice Cream: Delicious; a must-try. Very unique and flavorful. Not too heavy or creamy.

All the food was presented beautifully. Portion wise, the dishes are on the small side so make sure you order more if you're hungry.

We also had the wine flight which was not a very good value nor pairing; you should just order what you enjoy. They offered no explanation on the wine.

Service: Our waitress was nice and apologetic; however, since the food and wine was served by different food runners (huh?) they arrived at very oddly spaced times. In fact, we did not get our wine until mid-dessert which was off-putting since it's supposed to be a pairing.  When we asked about our food or wine, we would be told by different food runners that they weren't responsible for that.

Environment: Very nicely decorated. Tends to get loud near the stage so make sure you sit furthest away from the door.  Not a lot of space between tables in the seats against the wall. They had a live band and flamenco dancer and a nice crowd.

Parking: Side streets; U street if you're lucky. Building is easy to miss, but looks grey at night.

Initially they brought water to the table, but anything else you wanted had to be battled for at the bar...food, drinks.  All they did was bring whatever your ordered to the table. I feel like for a $700 minimum (for reserving the table) we should have been provided with table side ordering service as well.  There is also a $2.50 plating fee (DC law) for outside dessert.  The birthday girl had specialty cupcakes made at a bakery.  All 36 cupcakes were not eaten and there were no plates used, so I feel as though this should have been adjusted downward.  If we had a cake then the charge would have been per slice that was actually plated.  

I ordered a chicken dish that came with asparagus and potatoes.  Since I can't eat potatoes I inquired about getting double asparagus or a side salad.  I was informed that no adjustments could be made other than leaving an item off, but I could order an extra side of asparagus if I liked.  The food was meh.  I received a tiny sliver of a chicken breast, a shriveled up wing, and a small piece of thigh.  All were covered in skin and fatty.  I would have preferred a chicken breast, but the menu is so non-descriptive that you really have no idea what you're getting until it arrives.  The bartender wasn't very helpful at describing the dish. A friend ordered the bison short ribs (which were good) but they took an hour to come out.

Prior to the end of March 2012, this is what I would have said:  Vinoteca you get 4 stars, and this is why: you have a wonderful set up, and I have enjoyed many a happy hour, brunch (yay pancakes with ginger butter and bottomless!) and half priced Spanish wines on your Flamenco Sundays (try the Juan Gil- so good!).  Thank you for your amazing customer service, and I will keep recommending you to my friends and family, near and far.

From the end of March 2012 to now, Vinoteca, you get 2 stars- and I mean barely 2.  You get those 2 stars only due to my wonderful esteem of you before this point.  That being said, now that my sister and I tried to schedule my bridal shower in your event room and you suddenly raised the cost of doing so from the written, quoted price of 500 to 1250 then ultimately 1000 (before tax and gratuity), citing you own business costs like: lost revenue due to happy hour prices, and your patio opening and needing more staff (you know, things that have nothing to do with us, just your bottom line and own error), I have zero faith in you.

After multiple emails between my sister, myself and the event manager, with me expressing my frustration as I often review this place so highly to everyone I  know, I was told if maybe I had acted nicer like he did (seriously) the event manager corresponding with me, Jarell, would have helped find a compromise. All I can say is, I used to think you loved and respected your patrons, Vinoteca!  He did this with the owner, Paul, cc'd mind you.

An excerpt from Jarell to me, as I expressed these frustrations:

""[y]our chosen rhetoric has been less than good-natured and it seems your objective is to in some way 'bully' me into agreeing to the original quote.The threat of you 'modifying your Yelp and Open Table ratings (and having your guests do so)' is certainly not the appropriate way to get me to change my view on this matter and is less than mature...""  Good lord, is yelp not to tell others about quality of customer service?

Never again shall I recommend you or spend one hard earned dime on you, Vinoteca, and when I plan weekly brunch and friend's parties, I shall ALWAYS steer business as far away from you as possible.  I sincerely hope from the bottom of my heart that the 750 bucks you are screwing customers over for is worth losing thousands from a regular patron, friends, family and yelpers.

Went for dinner.  Asked to be seated outside.  Opened the menu and pointed to the happy hour sangria special.  Our waitress and the menu neglected to mention that this was only available at the bar (which is absurd anyway), and our Sangria was served and we were only informed upon receiving the bill that its full price outside.  We checked our phones, and the website which boast daily happy hour also said nothing about having to sit at the bar.   

Additionally, we ordered the chef's choice cheese plate (which was mediocre).  When it arrived, we called our waitress to ask her to explain what was on the plate she said ""umm...i'm not really the one to answer that...maybe you could ask a busboy.""   What??  We did...the busboy had no idea and pointed to our waitress.  I've a server and am usually patient....but c'mon.  

When we (politely) asked to speak to the manager upon receiving our bill, he told us that it had ""been their policy for 4 years not to serve happy hour outside.""

The waitresses excuse was that they ran out of the drink in order to provide a full order....yet somehow we were charged for the full thing! 

Overall, this restaurant used to be good, and it is no where near what it used to be in quality and ambiance. If you want a stomach ache that lasts for hours and a bill that is outrageous, then go for it. Otherwise, drive right by this place and go straight to the other, far better wine bars in the U street area.

The location is pretty cool - that's what the two stars are for...they have a patio in the back and outdoor seating in the front. But that's were the coolness ends. They want to be fancy here but are being ridiculous instead.

Before we received our food, I realized that the staff seemed to have a bit of an attitude. They barely look at you or give you a smile. All of them seemed miserable and not at all happy to be were they are. 

My husband ordered the heirloom tomato omelet, I had the starter beet and fennel salad for $9 and fries on the side...when they brought out my food, I thought this was a joke: The ""salad"" is a plate with six TINY half beets, a few dill leaves and sauce drizzled on top, served on a plate. The fennel pieces were so small, you couldn't even taste them. The fries weren't actual fries, they were pan roasted potato pieces that were very dry. I finished the ""salad"" within 1 minute and had to use a lot of water to gulp down the ""fries""...it was so ridiculous!! 

My husband's omelet contained like two small tomatoes and wasn't tasty at all!  

We eat out a lot and try out different restaurants and we're not looking to eat cheap fast food style. However, when something is advertised as a ""salad"", I would expect an actual salad - in a bowl with actual salad leaves. And for $9 I feel I can expect a decent starter portion. When you say ""fries"", I expect fried long potato sticks and not dry potato pieces. 

The funny thing: The ladies group next to us ordered the ""truffles"" for $6 and they came out the same time as my ""salad"". It was 4 (four!) TINY, TINY chocolate truffles, served on a large white porcelain plate...REALLY!? They cracked up and so did we!

Everyone at our table got wine flights, and in no flight was more than one of the wines even passable. The Trentadue, which sounded great on paper, ended up being so nasty, nobody even wanted it near them after a couple sips .  For a wine bar, such failures are unacceptable.

The poor experience didn't stop there.  The service was slow and spotty; usually that doesn't really bother me, but at the end of this night -- IMMEDIATELY following dessert -- the waiter shooed us away, saying another party had the table reserved.  Excuse me? YOUR slow and inattentive service was the only reason we were still there! The whole episode was unprofessional and irritating.

The food was no saving grace either.  The fettucini was dry and rubbery, as if it had been prepared by someone who'd never attempted pasta before. My friend's gnocchi was borderline inedible; she ended up leaving 75% of the plate untouched.

Our server, a very nice young woman who tried, disappeared for long, long stretches and was a bit too BFF when she did come around, sitting next to my friend on the banquette.  I think she may have been overwhelmed with too many tables.  

Our four-top, near the front of what I think is the main dining room, was soon climbed over by the large party (6? 7? 8? people) that crammed into the seating area around the table in the window.  My friend nearest that table was uncomfortable and frequently elbowed, but there was nowhere for us to move.  The bar was packed.

It really only had four entrees, though there was a larger section of lighter fare which somehow included things I don't normally think of as light. I heard about their sliders and instantly thought of the miniburgers sold at the bar I frequent. So I have to admit I was surprised to find that a beef slider was only one of many gourmet choices, that included lamb, bison, tuna, portabello mushroom, and venison. And they are all the same price allowing you to mix and match any variety. I thought that was a nice touch. In addition to sampling the sliders, I had the mussels which came in a generous portion, but were mediocre at best. 

The wine list was decent though for a wine bar it probably could have been a bit more extensive. I ordered a Claret (a Bordeaux style blend) from a local Virginia winery which I like. It wasn't that great at first (which is why I've never bought a bottle at the winery) but as the wine had time to breath it did open up and turned out to be pretty decent. That said, the markups on the wines were not unusual. For a holiday weekend Sunday the place wasn't that crowded thought the new outdoor patio filled up quickly. Local noise ordinances shut the patio down at about 9pm though, a little early for my taste.

My friends and I visited Cork for brunch. Every item on the menu is supposed to be ""shared"", according to both the verbiage on the menu and the explanation from our waitress, and yet the menu largely consists of unshareable small plates. How exactly are you supposed to share a poached egg, or a yogurt parfait? We were also instructed by our waitress to order 2-3 plates each, an instruction we chose to ignore. The portions were SMALL- again, leading us to wonder why ""sharing"" was so emphasized- yet delicious. We had crispy polenta, house-made sausage with leeks, and a Parmesan egg tart. We also ordered a delectable cinnamon bun. Again, everything tasted amazing, but my poor friends were famished and the meal did little to put a dent in their hunger. 
The waitress was rude and inattentive, I'm afraid to say. The food was delivered as it was ready, which I do not appreciate as it makes everyone at the table uncomfortable. The waitress was also very upset that we didn't order more food. I don't like to feel pressured by the waitstaff to eat more, just so that they'll receive a larger tip. I really expected more.

This is a wine bar, right???

I was expecting some snobbery, because my friends had said Cork kinda has that reputation, but we showed up and were promptly and energetically escorted to a table.

A couple friends and I went in late just to have a glass of wine. They live in the neighborhood, Logan Circle, and I was a curious visitor returning to the city who blessed him with the best job in the world at a wine bar (yes, that's definitely Sonoma). We ordered a modest red--it totally doesn't matter what it was. Something around $45. Something easy.

So there I was, just taking the place in. Good crowd, though a little older. That's not necessarily awesome for me, but it's great for the neighborhood and for DC. Anyhow, no sobbery yet.

And then the server returned with our bottle and presented it. Now, wine presentation is a really complicated process about which one could be excruciatingly picky. But I'm not. Basically, if you bring the right bottle, let someone perform the quickest of checks to see whether it's corked, and then pour around the table, I'm fine. I don't care about the niceties of how you extract the cork. I don't care if you hold the bottle still and keep the label facing me at all times. I don't care if the cork makes a little popping sounds as it finally leaves the bottle. I don't care if you pour for the ladies first or just go around the table.

But what I do care about is if you flaunt your supposed awesomeness so amazingly embarrassingly awfully horribly badly that the world kind of winces a little bit and gets mildly nauseous.

While my friend was tasting the taste, our server took the cork and smelled it. Wait, what's the harm in that? That's fine, you say?!

No, it's not fine, because she smelled the thing as if it were a cigar, dragging its short length beneath her nose. After that examination, which seemed like it should have been measured in minutes instead of seconds, she let pass a smug, satisfied look, smiling insipidly.

We're not talking about a quick check for that dank cardboard scent you get when you smell the end of the cork that has actually been exposed to the juice. We're talking about the most ostentatious, deeply breathed wine check I've seen since the stereotypical drunk guy swirled his taste so hard that it flew out of his huge Reidel and hit his own crotch.

Sorry, but the side of the cork contains no clues about whether the juice is good. So while I'm sure you think you were just waaaay cooler than the kids sitting before you--paying your bills--you actually weren't. Treating us that way kinda makes you a loser actually. Get over yourself and help me enjoy a nice bottle of wine.

For table seating you must order food, so, as a wine bar, Cork really misses.  My GF and I went on a weekday night, plenty of seating and were denied service, since we didn't plan to eat.

My date and I ordered bruschetta, potatoes, chicken and lamb.  She ordered the wine paired with the chicken (a rose, if you can believe it [it was good though]), and I got the red paired with the lamb.  Guess which dish came first?  the lamb!

Well, this seems odd.   You are supposed to drink wine in increasing order of heaviness, so we blew our palates out with the uber red that paired with the lamb.

Now, this might be OK if the food was great; it's not.  It's decidedly average.  The lamb was not made to order, but clearly braised and covered in heavy sauce (claimed to be pomegranate).  The chicken was very well prepared, but pretty bland.  The potatoes were good, though a bit undercooked (amazing since they were the last to be served and took forever to come out).  The bruschetta was decent.

Now, to the most egregious aspect of our evening: the pours.  My date and I had two glasses of wine each.  We were informed of the wine ""flights"" (no menu for the flights...weird), but chose to get single servings.  They came out and I thought we had been given a tasting portion.  It was  by no means a 4 oz. pour.  For the price (between 8-12 bucks a glass on average), this is incredibly steep, especially when both Veritas and Proof provide a full 4oz pour for similar prices.  We noticed a couple next to us getting wine flights, and their pours were almost the same as ours!!?!?!

So, in short, Cork is amazingly overpriced, very crowded, and has mediocre food.  Expect it to be voted Best Wine Bar in DC!

We went fairly early and were able to get seats at the bar.  The wine list is very good, but not extraordinary.  The bartender was happy to give tastes of various wines and poured a generous glass.  However, TWICE he poured glasses for us combining DIFFERENT bottles!  I must have been in a coma when mixing wine from different bottles became an approved practice.  Perhaps this happens at other restaurants, but at a wine bar?  Absolutely not.  

The marinated mushrooms were divine, I can't stop thinking about them, so tender and flavorful.  The scallops, unfortunately, were despicably overcooked and dry.   The spiced carrot sauce, while interesting, would have overwhelmed even well prepared scallops.

Our experience was further marred by the arrival of a woman who had bathed in perfume before heading out to dine.  This has nothing to do with Cork or its responsibility to its diners.  I just wish that everyone in the world understood that it is an unconscionable sin to wear perfume when heading to a wine bar or tasting.

Unfortunately, I have found little to like about this place.  The first time I went there for dinner, the quoted 45 min to an hour wait turned into close to two.  An entire glass of red wine was spilled down my back by a server - charming - and although they comped my next two glasses of wine and  offered to pay for the dry cleaning bill, I think they could have handled the situation a lot better.  They seemed more concerned with wiping down the barstool I was sitting on than worrying about the fact that I was soaked, or that we'd already been waiting for an hour and 1/2 for a table.       

Eventually we were shown our table, sat down and ordered.  The food was mediocre at best.  Definitely nothing to write home about.

And yet, after that experience, I went back.  Always one for second chances, I thought my first experience there may have been a fluke and I liked the potential of the place - love the cozy interior.  While waiting for our table, the boyfriend and I got a glass of wine at the bar.  Directly in front of the bar is the main walkway, meaning unless you can get a seat at the bar, which can be hard to do, you're pretty much in the way of just about everyone - servers, hostesses, other customers trying to get to their table.  Consequently, you spend a significant amount of time awkwardly moving about so people can get through (hence the wine spill during my first trip there even though I had a seat at the bar).  Once we were seated, we ordered a variety of small plates -  calamari, grilled flat iron, mushrooms - again, mediocre, and kind of bland.  The one redeeming factor - desert.

We sat there for a few seconds kind of stunned and thinking he was coming back with a corrected menu or something.

I saw this place while searching for restaurant week places and decided to give it a try with some friends since it looked clean and trendy on the website.  But here are the main reasons for my rating and the fact that we will never come back:

1. Our entrees took nearly an hour to be served.  We ordered two dishes from the restaurant week menu and two from the regular brunch menu.  There were patrons that came 20-30 minutes after us who got their food first.  We think the kitchen prepared most of our food on time but looked like our server just let it sit under the heat lamp as the waffles were soggy, the chicken was almost cold, and the tuna steak burger was soaked into buns.  The medium-rare steak we ordered was also extremely rare.

2.  When we asked our server why the food was taking so long (again, we mentioned that other patrons who got there after us already got there meals a while ago), we were offended because the server used the excuse there was a backlog in the kitchen.  As you can see in the picture, the place was not packed at all and there were no patrons upstairs.  The least the server could do was at least pretend to be apologetic for taking nearly an hour for the food to come out.

3.  For a place that has ""wine bar"" in its name, we were kind of surprised the server did not go through the normal routine of pouring wine.  First, when she opened the bottle, she didn't present the label, then she immediately poured the wine into all four glasses without asking any one of us to do a quick taste.  Plus, during the whole time we had no entrees in front of us ,and while our glasses were getting empty, she never checked up to see if we were okay with the wine.  That's why we just stopped at one bottle. 

4.  Of all the open tables in the restaurant, they sat us in the darkest and surprisingly dirty corner of the first floor.  I even had a reservation so it's not like we just randomly walked in and they had no other choice to put us where ever there was an open table.  I really hate to think it, but we were the only minorities in the restaurant when we walked in and felt really singled out in the restaurant.

The reason we didn't address this with the server or the manager was that we felt it wasn't even worth it.  At that point, the less we saw of the server, the better.  Again, no plans to go back here and we actually felt really bad for our friends because we suggested this place.

The risotto: This came piping hot but really had no flavor. I started to be concerned when the waiter offered us salt and pepper as soon as he delivered the food, and sure enough, it tasted unsalted.

Both my friends order the burger which seemed to just fall completely flat, was overcooked, did not have toasted buns (and when asked, they seemed to just place the entire burger into a microwave or oven...which of course overcooked the meat).

The waitress really tried to sell me on doing the pre fix menu but I kept telling her I was vegan -- I don't think she knew what that meant, but ok, not a big deal. My food came when she brought the other people their appetizers and then she seemed perplexed when I ""still"" didn't want to order something as my entree... Awkward. So it was a bit lame to not eat while my group had their entrees (obviously the longest part of a meal). My friends both got the chicken + waffles which they said was good and the portion was decent, but they both wanted more maple syrup. 

This place is pricey -- the mimosas are decent but at 9 dollars a pop feel quite small. The coffee is way overpriced at 4 dollars for a small cup.

Reading the owner's blog, Slate seemed poised to open without a hitch. Well, it opened. But there were hitches, lots of them. And I'm going easy on them since I visited the first night. Of course, I will give them another chance or two.

Here's the thing, restaurateurs. Just because you put a certain price point on your offerings, and you do a great job decorating, and you get buzz going before your open, doesn't mean our experience is just automatically gonna be great. You have to WORK. You have to TRAIN YOUR STAFF to know the menu, know the wines (esp if you are calling yourself a wine bar). Check in on your customers. If someone orders a craft beer and you are out of it 1) come back and tell them you are out of it, and 2) don't suggest a Bud Light as an option! Casual shouldn't mean sloppy and careless.

We were there for 3 hours on opening night, and not because we were all cozy. That's how long it took from apertif to finishing our main dishes, and getting the check, which was wrong, as they charged us for things they never brought out because they were out of them! We didn't order dessert as we really didn't need to sit around another hour! It's not that they were understaffed, there were many workers buzzing around. The table next to us complained loudly the whole time - they were rewarded with I'm guessing a complimentary dessert presented by the chef himself.

The food - not memorable. I got the wrong salad brought to me, and in the interest of saving time, just stuck with it. It was romaine lettuce with some tomato slices on top and some olives, and...that was pretty much it. Can't even remember what my dining mates got, but there was not much raving.

The wine - I'm no oenophile, but judging from the service we got, neither is the staff. Whatever I had was good, I guess. It would be cool if there was more to the description of the wine so people like me can know more about what we're getting.

When we walked in on time for our reservation, there was no one present to greet us or seat us; the restaurant appeared to have no staff and just a few diners. We waited for several minutes until the waitress finally appeared from the back. You guys... you can't leave your dining room or front room unattended. Not only is that just not very welcoming, it's also a huge liability. Our service was generally slow (about 20 minutes wait before we got our drinks) and we were given the explanation that another server had failed to show up that morning. Okay, so where is your on-call staff to replace them? Apparently non-existent, because this poor server was running the entire restaurant since opening all by herself. They also were ""out of"" bloody marys, and then said the only remaining option we could have with our brunch entrees was a mimosa. Despite having a full menu of brunch drinks, they wouldn't allow us to substitute even though they were the ones who were out of ingredients.

It's really too bad this place seems to be having some service and/or management issues (and they do seem go regularly have issues, as it was prime brunch time on a Sunday and only two other tables had diners) because the food was decent.

Summary (on a scale of 1 to 5 stars):
Food: 2 stars
Drinks: 2 stars
Atmosphere: 5 stars
Service: 5 stars
Price: 2 stars

I don't like to write negative reviews, but I want to be honest here. Philos brunch was really disappointing. We did the all-inclusive bottomless thang. $35. Bottomless food and drinks.

Food: Wasn't good. They technically did have the standard things-- a couple omelettes, a couple benes, french toast, and event crepes. I guess it's a good thing we were doing bottomless though, because if I had tried to just order the omelette and be satisfied, it wouldn't be nearly enough. The best thing was the grilled cheese, but it still was very basic- ya know, bread and cheese. Oh also, there where ""chocolate pancakes"" on the menu, but when we ordered them, they are actually regular packages with a few chocolate chips. Overall just underwhelming. 

Drinks: Also meh. The bloody mary was ok, actually had some decent flavor but again nothing special or memorable. Only garnish was a lime wedge. The mimosas were really sugary (is it fake orange juice??) with very little champagne. I wish I could have just ordered wine. Wouldn't want to come and just order one of these drinks. 

Atmosphere: Super cute! Smaller than I pictured. Floor to ceiling windows let in great sunlight. This would be a great place to come for happy hour or a casual glass of wine. It would also be a great place to rent out for an event.

Service: The staff was fantastic. Very friendly and attentive. The nice people are why I wish I was writing a better review. Great people though.

Price: Not worth the price. I left wanting to go out to lunch. Not because I was hungry, but because none of the food or drinks were satisfying.

4259,Philos Mezze + Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=k3fVe2RR9SbABLmldKJQsg,"I'll start with the good and point out the service was nice. Seated quickly, and at an enjoyable window seat. The waiter was attentive and knowledgeable, did all he could to make our dining experience as it should have been. But he could not make up for the performance of the kitchen the evening we were there. 

I'm more than willing to accept not every dish at a tapas restaurant will be outstanding; but when I have to find a reason to like even one dish, there is a problem. We ordered a couple of the happy hour specials and a few items from the regular menu. The over-riding problem with all the food was a failure to understand how to cook the food. 

The cheese plate, not involving cooking, was ok. Only one of the cheeses gave me pause, in that way an enjoyable cheese causes you to marvel at the magic of cheese making. That might have been the high point. The cheese-filled hush puppies, though not flawed, lacked a solid fried dough crunch, to me a hallmark of a hush puppy. 

I started to get worried when the hand-cut fries arrived. They were hot, I'll give them that. But they were pale, without a hint of golden brown, nor the crisp exterior one hopes for in a fried, salty snack. A proper fry should be twice fried; these looked, felt and tasted like the second, hotter bath in oil was foregone. 

The ""zucchini fritters"" we're just sad. A soggy mess without taste. Let me say no more of them, least their memory come flooding back. 

I will pick a restaurant because they serve Brussel Sprouts. I grew up with them and love them cooked all sorts of ways. But a key component of a BS dish is that they be cooked. The chef at Philos doesn't appear to share this view. They arrived at best warmed from the heat that had browned the outer leaves. But the cores were sometimes warm, and completely raw. Not a trace of softening, nor the reduction in bitterness the heat brings. I did bring this to the attention of our waiter, who did most graciously take them back and have the kitchen try again. He brings them back, promising this bowl is as it should be. And they were the same. I noticed the stalks haven't been trimmed nor sliced. Even I know this must be done if you want the cores to cook, even the slightest. They feel Brussel Sprouts are best served undercooked. 

On to the main dish. We came here in part to enjoy the Grilled Octopus. The waiter suggested we select a backup; he doubted the octopus was in stock and we chose the Seared Sea Scallops. In the end, we ordered the Mussels. They were acceptable, some over cooked, others cooked through but still soft. But why include (stale) bread when there is no sauce?

It was a Wednesday evening in a not busy restaurant and you don't have two of the obviously desirable seafood dishes available? That makes me question how the kitchen is run. 

The staff could tell I was most disappointed in our meal. A restaurant in this part should expect to be held to a decent standard; I'm not out at a suburban strip mall. I was offered the excuse of a new cook; his first night in fact. That's no way to run a restaurant. It's staffing issues are its own. I expect a good meal regardless. This excuse, combined with the incompleteness of the menu options gives me concern for the way the restaurant is run. I hope not a fatal flaw, but that leaves me crossing it off my list of dinner options in this neck of the woods. 

I'll close by saying I'm not a bitchy or too difficult a diner. But I know my way around a kitchen and when I go out to eat, I expect to be reminded I'm a mere amateur. Not feeling for less money I could have stayed at home and done better.

The parillada had a tasty sauce with it but the steak and pork chops were overcooked and super dry-- chicken was cooked right though (juicy with crispy skin).

First, our table for 5 wasn't ready; when we arrived, it was like it was a surprise (one of us was on time and checked in, the rest arrived 5 minutes late #unsuckWMATA).  The waiter rushed to set up a table in the middle of the room to make a 4 top a 5 top, bringing up the edges to make the square a circle.  It was difficult for the waiters to get around us, but no matter.
The bloody mary bar...well...wasn't.  At 14th street  Barcelona, far superior to this one, there's a person at the bloody mary bar who walks you through a plethora of yummy and fresh ingredients, and that person makes your drink.  At this one, there were only a few ingredients sitting on the corner of the bar...a variety of bitters, no celery (?), no bacon (great feature of 14th st), no manchego cheese, a few shrimp (sitting in water, presumably melted ice), and one kind of bloody mary mix that was so heavy with horseradish it was undrinkable.  There was a bartender who seemed to be a bit confused by the expectation that he was going to assist us...even when we asked for ice for our drinks (there was none).  We went up two at a time and asked repeatedly; ice never came.  We ended up asking for a glass of ice at the table. It was like no one there had ever even seen the setup at 14th street.  Weird.
It wasn't just this (although this was most disappointing, I brought friends there to experience the bloody mary bar); the service was incredibly slow, an order was lost, and we had to pile up dishes as we finished with them on such a small table to make room, and stop waiters to ask them to clear them off.
It may have been a bad day for them, as we did get a complimentary dish because of the wait for food; ironically, it was the same dish that our waiter forgot to serve.  odd.
I will go back for an after work drink or tapas outside, but there are too many great brunch places in DC to experience that again.  Very disappointing.
I will say, the French toast was yummy, but hey, I can make that at home.

I asked our waiter to suggest two wines, and he did not disappoint. The service was fabulous. The wine was fabulous. The bread was fabulous. However, the food was a disappointment. The frog legs were served lukewarm and frozen in the middle. The waiter returned with the news that the kitchen had run out of eggplant, my other selection. He then suggested patatas bravas and spinach-chickpea cazuela and promptly brought them to the table.  These dishes were quite good. He followed with fully cooked frog legs and told us all of the food was on the house and would not be on the check. The manager came to our table and offered apologies, as well. The wait staff was attentive and helpful. My friend and I ordered and split the second glass of wine. We were running late and the check came. Not only was I charged for all of the food, I was charged for two glasses of the wine that we shared. I was already 15 minutes late, so I paid the bill, left the waiter a generous tip, and left. The wait staff is great but clearly there was a disconnect in communication. I didn't have time to deal with what had happened nor should I have had to. This should have been taken care of without my protest, as promised. Had I more time, I would have insisted the bill altered as indicated. I was torn how to rate because this restaurant has great potential and atmosphere and maybe it was an off night.

The first time I went, I got the lentil soup. It tasted good, but was really simple- something I could have easily made at home. I got a chunky eggplant dip with tomatoes, which was cold and not that tasty. Again, I felt kind of meh about it. We got a grilled asparagus dish too, which really was just grilled asparagus with not much added flavor.

The second time I went, I got the zuchinni pancakes. This was four days ago, yet I can't really remember how they tasted, beyond that they were eggy, which didn't appeal to me. Also, they were very small and there were only two of them. The dolmas had a nice flavor, but the rice was cold and had hardened slightly, which was unpleasant. Finally, I got a salad with arugula, walnuts, and feta cheese. Not sure if this was some weird type of feta, but it had a weird animal-y flavor that I didn't find appealing.

The servers were OK. For some reason, they waited at leat 20 minutes after we arrived to take our drink orders. I think they must have given us a full hour before taking our food orders. Not sure if they gave us so long because we were a larger party.

They forgot that I had ordered the 3 ounce wine and brought a 6 ounce wine instead. i didn't realize the error and when charged for the 6 ounce didn't do anything because the bill was already complicated enough what with being in a party of 12 people.

We ate there on Wednesday evening, and it was at least 75 degrees inside the restaurant.  The experience of tropical dining was just unpleasant, and I couldn't figure out why the restaurant staff wouldn't just crack the door open to get some air flowing.

As for the food, these are small even for small plates.  We started with the three spreads (hummus, baba ganoush, and a red pepper spread); to be honest, these tasted virtually interchangeable to me.  They were the same consistency, the same color, and they all had a muddled flavorlessness to them (if I had to describe them, I'd call them grey in taste).  Equally grey were the zucchini pancake (it looked much better than it was; in reality, it was a too oily zucchini fritter), and the chicken meatballs (dry, dry, dry).  Even the bread, which I expected to be warm and flavorful as is the custom at Turkish restaurants, was flat tasting -- we were eating it merely to fill up.   

The worst part is that the service was also pretty much invisible.  My sense is that small plates restaurants should have a more present kind of server, since people routinely under-order and then decide to get a few more plates.  Our server was practically non-existant and when hunger beckoned and we wanted something else, we had to chase him down (perhaps he was standing outside to avoid the heat of the dining room?).

The location is prime - right off Dupont Circle on popular P Street, the storefreont once inhabited by Johnny's Half Shell.

My first visual impression was a good one - the walls lined with weathered looking wood holding bottles of wine is inviting and appealing. The brick walls and tile wall hangings add to the ambiance. Then I noticed the drop ceiling (complete with 1 or two slightly mismatched replacement tiles), and suddenly felt like I was back in my 1970s construction office building.  Kind of ruins what would be a gorgeous interior otherwise.

The server, while friendly, didn't go out of his way to point out any specialties, or make any recommendations.  One of my fellow diners didn't know anything about the restaurant walking in, and pointed out that besides the prices, there was no other indication that this was a ""small plates"" concept.   While most are probably aware, it would be nice to print that somehow on the menu or explain it to diners.

As for the food, the flavors were all right, but the portion sizes didn't seem to jive with the prices.  The spreads (hummus, muhammara) came in slightly less than ice cream scoop sizes, for about 6-7 bucks a pop.  I suppose you can get away with it in this location, but nearly everything seemed to be about 20% overpriced.  The kebab platter for $25 seemed like a better value than the individual plates, so we opted for that.  The shish kebab was the standout - nicely cooked to a medium with rich flavor.

As for the service, food came extremely quickly, which was nice.  However, there were some seriously overanxious busboys that took away from the overall experience.  They tried to take the plate with 4 calamari rings left away, to which we said ""no thanks, still working on it.""  My friend then took one of the rings and the busboy tried to swoop in again, and then stalked behind him.  We actually had to tell him to please come back later for the plate. This happened with an additional plate, where we were still enjoying the last morsels, and the plate was promptly lifted out.  Note that we weren't waiting on any more food, so space on the table was not an issue, nor was the restaurant particularly busy, so the  plates surely weren't urgently needed.

If I were to judge the food in a vacuum, ignoring the spendy prices for small portions, the grabby busboy, and the almost, but not quite charming interior, I'd probably be in the 4 star range.  But all the other missteps really detracted from the overall experience, and I can't really say I'd be heading back any time soon.

We began by ordering two of the reds from the wines of the week and were glad we opted for the half glass pours.  Barely drinkable! So we took a chance and ordered two other reds that fared only slightly better.  At that point we decided to stop exploring the wines.  Probably good we did as the table service was abysmal.  

Our dinners were totally forgettable.  My wife ordered the quail which was passable.  I ordered the steak en croute.  When I pulled back the pastry crust the steak looked and tasted so unappetizing that I took two or three bites and pushed aside the plate. The only word to describe this dish is ""Yuk.""

My wife's steak with mushroom sauce had a dearth of mushrooms, and the pear tart's crust was thick and dry. All in all, there was no in between on the food. It was quite good, or quite mediocre. Nothing I would have sent back, but getting it on the table was the real issue.

The baked desert I had was supposed to have almonds, but if it did I certainly could not taste them.  Also the chef seems to rely on a lot of sweet sauces and other accoutrements which really detracts from the food.

4851,Bistrot Lepic & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=zyVgXF_ZXB-TtdxYUxzrQw,"What an underwhelming dining experience. I was really disappointed after reading such great reviews about this ""gem"". This week two of my girlfriends and I went out for Restaurant Week here. We were instantly greeted with a curt, apathetic waiter, which I figured was a part of the natural French dining experience. I wouldn't let it get me down. 

We started with our appetizers and I got the Risotto with Shrimp, which was by far the best item ordered at our table. The shrimp was grilled to perfection, atop a warm bed of perfectly salted risotto. My friends got the Onion Tart (great flavor, but was heavier than it needed to be. I imagined a flakier dish) and the Pesto Soup (fine, but watery and unimpressive).

As for entrees we got the Stew, which was done well. The lamb inside was cooked perfectly. But I was shocked to see how random the Potato Crusted Salmon actually was. It was literally a salmon filet tucked inside a McDonalds hashbrown, as someone previously mentioned. It was a latke at best. There was absolutely nothing special about it. Nothing about the dish clicked. There were just two separate items put next to each other, and left atop a grape sauce, which did even less to bring the flavors together. So underwhelming. Finally we got one vegetarian entree (whatever random vegetables could be scrounged for such a dish, but hey what's to be expected.)

Finally the part I am most upset by... dessert. The Creme Brulee was quite simply, not Creme Brulee. Perhaps it was because we came during Restaurant Week... or maybe because our waiter warmed the dish before serving it, and maybe it was old. Either way, the top was perfectly crusted with that hard carmelized sugar layer, but what lay beneath did not remind me of any creme brulee I had ever tried before (and I've had a few in my day). Somehow the insides became gelatinous, flan-like I'd say... and I would go so far as to say it was unenjoyable. 

So, all in all, I would not recommend-- but if you decide to check this place out, don't order the Creme Brulee! Or the Salmon MacDo mess! And as people said earlier, take their warning and sit upstairs!

We thought to try it and experience something new. The ambiance is very nice and quaint. I ordered the rainbow trout and my husband the shrimp salad. My trout was a bit dry and overpowered by pesto. My husband thought his was decent but not worthy of a french restaurant.  We could have easily found this closer to home. The service was minimal. There was one waitress for the whole restaurant, and though its small, she was in a rush to take our order as if we were in a fast food restaurant. The customer service alone was a reason not to go back! I wouldn't go back nor would I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good french cuisine. Bistro Bis in capital hill is 10x better!

It is possible that we just hit it on a bad night, so take this with a grain of salt.  Overall the experience was fair.  Not terrible, but definitely not excellent.  That said I am giving them the benefit of the doubt will try it again, but this past experience was not what I expected.
My first impression came as the waiter set down the bread with the cold individually wrapped butter packets.  Not a huge deal, but I did notice.  When it was time to place my order, I was politely told that they no longer had the item I wanted.  The fact that they ran out of something is less of a sticking point than the fact that I was told only after I tried to place my order.  Once the appetizers did arrive the server had to ask who ordered what.  I had to ask myself was this really one of the best restaurants in DC or was I at TGI Fridays.
My wife ordered the rack of lamb medium rare and to say it came our medium well would be generous.  Rarely do I ever send food back, but I thought she should have sent that back immediately.  It was late and she was hungry so she just ate it.   We did not order desert.
Like I said, I can't believe my experience was  typical and I will try again.  However I can't with clear conscience give them anything more than two stars after this experience.

What I will criticize was the pathetic service we experienced tonight.  To the waiter - when I ask for wine recommendation, don't be come pedantic and haughty.  I'm asking for your recommendation because I can't come up with anything, and I'm assuming that you'd have a good idea.  Also, it's not acceptable to be at the end of the second course with no one coming to the table to fill the water glasses or simply check in with us.  I was annoyed when no one offered to take my coat, but two people offered to take the coats from the couple who came a few minutes after us.  

Ultimately, I didn't feel welcome.  Perhaps it was asking to be seated away from the door when that table was offered to use when we walked in.  Regardless, the level of service was well below anything acceptable.

We're talking about main entrees that had to be sent back. New Zealand mussels, overcooked so badly that they had turned to rubber. So laden with breadcrumbs, it looked like the dish came from McDonald's. 

Or a casserole that had more filling than meat and vegetables.

4905,Bistrot Lepic & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=9iSNTz6ySSI2jn8xzExQ3w,"Really a two and a half star review.

My parents took me out to dinner during restaurant week because they had a great experience here. Maybe that got my expectations too high but the folks were pretty disappointed with our meal as well. 

I'd like to star by pointing out I'm allergic to seafood. This limited me to about 4 options and the desert menu. 

My app was the onion tart with bacon. This was very disappointing.  It was dry, had no onion flavor, and the tart crust was dense, dry and hard. 

My main course was pretty good, curry chicken with saffron rice. That gave me about half a chicken, which is a large portion in a delicious sauce. At first I thought it was too much, like chicken place into a bowl of soup. However, once I began to cut apart the chicken it was soaked up. The chicken was perfectly cooked, even the white meat, juicy succulent, and tender. The saffron rice had little saffron flavor, but mostly a buttery flavor (I wont argue with that, though).
My father's dish was the duck casserole, with three types of duck (or something like this). It had nicely cooked duck, tucked into a dry mealy bean ...thing. 
My mother got the potato encrusted salmon, this was actually a very good dish. However, this brings be to  my only gripe about my and her dish... the sauces weren't tied in with the rest of the food. Now maybe my view point is clouded from living in Italy, and Italian style cooking, this could be extremely French after all, but the disconnect with the dish was rather bothersome. My mother's salmon came with a grape dressing drizzled around the edges. It was sweet and creamy, which was paired with buttery (almost fried tasting) potato and rich salmon (I tasted everything but the fish itself). Somehow this flavor combination seemed very arbitrary and bizarre to me.
Similar to my dish, it was obvious that the chicken was cooked separately from the curry sauce. In every curry I've been taught to make coating the meat with the spices is very important. Even if you remove the meat from the pan to reduce or create a new sauce of that base. The curry chicken was the only chicken item on the menu, so it baffled me as to why they would need the ability to apply different sauces.


The desserts were decent, I have a lemon tart which was exactly that, TART. I LOVED the filling. hardly ever do you find a good lemon tart with good lemon flavor and tartness to boost. However, they used the same tart shells for my onion tart. A disappointment. My father got un' ile flottante, which was pretty tasty.

Service was excellent, and wine was good. But how hard is it to serve a good wine? Pop, pour, serve. 

This might be the lowest I've rated a restaurant on yelp, however my criteria goes up with price. Moby Dick's out ranked this place by three stars and it is FAR from a fine french restaurant.
Now I have a theory about this experience. Most reviews were positive and even my parents had a better meal at a different date. So my theory is this, because it was restaurant week, Lepic made ample amounts of food well in advance. More then normal, and further in advance then they normally would (almost all restaurants prep their dishes ahead of time). This it led to several snafus, such as tart crusts being dry and tough, or the flavors of sauces not properly marrying. Maybe attending earlier in week? (we ate on a wed) or NOT during restaurant week? I will try again and reevaluate but maybe not until the fall or winter, when I can try a different non-sea food oriented menu.
