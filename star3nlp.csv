I told him it was my birthday when he first came over, and then I asked if he had any ""rose"" flavored wines since I love rose anything.  No, NOT Rose with the apostropher above the E, rose like the flower.  Is this really such a weird question?  I had an awesome ROSE wine at Match and I wanted to see if they had anyting similiar.  He looked at me like I was crazy and then we had a waitress serving us.....  I got the feeling we were not good enough.  They have a small food menu which is nice I guess - not large by any means.  But the truffle mac and cheese was decent, and the chocolate fondue was tasty (but small).  And to get the pound cake, it's an extra $5 (what?!).  They had plenty of wine flights, which was cool since I like variety in my flights.  And the pre-chosen factor made it easy for me.  The rest of the menu is definitely long, and you should know what you're doing wine wise if you want to make it through.

So they might want to reconsider that one. Honestly I think the menu needs a revision overall, I mean they removed charcuterie and cheese plate from the menu, which is a staple of pretty much any wine bar.

The bar is circular and actually seats quite a few people. There are also a few high-top bar tables.

The staff were somewhat knowledgeable but did not impress. I asked a few questions that the bartenders seemed to either not know the answer or appeared to kinda just make something up. Hmmmm. Also note that the wine is served in Bodega glasses, not the wine glasses you're used to seeing.

I went with the sparkling wine flight. I only liked one of the three options. The third option was so sweet, I couldn't finish it. It was really awful. Unfortunately, this was the only sparkling flight, so you are stuck with those abysmal options. The pour also varied greatly depending on the state of the bartender since they freehand the pours. My friend got significantly more than I did for no apparent reason.

Our appetizers (homemade bread and steak sliders) came out quickly however, which was essential because we were famished and needed food to balance the wine flights. 

We had the old world wine flight, which was not great.

He also was very kind to comp one dish, as that dish came later than the rest of our (already slow) dinner.

Flight definitely has a very large wine list and I like the concept of ordering different flights of wines. It gives the drinker the option of trying so many different varietals without having to order glassfuls at a time. Not to say there's anything wrong with drinking a lot of wine, but if you're just looking for a taste, the flight concept works great.

Where I think Flight didn't do it for me was the ambiance. I think I just like my wine bars of the dimly lit and cozy style (similar to Dickson's). Flight leans a bit more to the modernist side and it just didn't present itself as somewhere I'd like to just sit, sip on wines, and enjoy for a while.

The appetizers are definitely over priced but at $7 a glass for happy hour wines, it kind of evens out. Kind of.

I think there were 3 flight choices of reds and a few whites as well. We shared the bread basket and savory cheese plate. Both of which were good (but maybe a bit pricey).

I was in town to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday so this place made for a fun girl's night. 

Ambiance: (4 out of 5) This tapas place has a very classy vibe and the atmosphere is dark, modern and hip. They had a small patio in the front of the restaurant but we opted to sit inside.

Service: (3 out of 5) As it was a busy Saturday night when we arrived we waited a few minutes before our server came to our table. He was nice but definitely seemed distracted and after our meal we had to ask for the check and it took a while for him to come back. 

Food (3 out of 5) We identified a few tapas to share and surprisingly the thing that sounded the most simple ended up being my favorite (the goat cheese). I thought that everything was okay or fine but I can't say I would rave about it. Am I a bit of a tapas snob? Perhaps. After a week in Spain and many visits to different tapas places I have some high standards! I do wish that I had tried the jamon and manchego croquettes because I'm sure those would have been more of a winner than the chorizo.

We couldn't even get clean cups and it took MULTIPLE tries. We asked the servers for new cups...and yet they couldn't manage to check the new ones they brought whether they were clean!??! Lipstick marks and residue from possibly sangria....I understand they might get busy and stick these things in the dishwasher, but is it even functioning bro? To top it off, the servers would virtually never come by (and we were seated outside so there were plenty of servers walking around) so it took a total of 40 minutes to get clean cups and our orders in. And we only got our orders in because I snapped and said ""we are ready to place our orders"" when the server was just going to drop off a (finally) clean cup and leave. It was painfully clear we were ready to order so I have no idea what the deal was. But to be fair, the food comes out pretty quickly thereafter, which makes up for time lost.

This place gets a three-star rating in the midst of its cleanliness and horrible service because the food was good. I shared four tapas with a friend: croquettes, steak, risotto, and the empanadas. The steak was my favorite, with the croquettes coming in a close second. The risotto is bland-don't order!

Oh and I don't get what the deal with the sangria is here...it's so obvious it's boxed red wine-which pretty much tastes like juice! My friend and I shared the pitcher and it was obvious that it was a waste of money after our first cheers and sip. And the bill at the end...to make it easy we asked if it was possible to get two bills for our entire table, which was intended to make our server's life easier with the number of people there were. He said no, and to just put the separate credit card amounts on the bill....no duh, that's how it's done old style and we clearly know how to do that. And then he brought out the bill and we took a while doing the math and all that jazz, and then he comes over and says, ""if you mark which ones you want, I can separate it into different bills for you..."" UM. That's what we had wanted for you, for us, for everyone about 10 minutes ago!?!?

The GREAT: Brunch.

For brunch the must trys are any of their benedicts, the lemon ricotta pancakes, and the bread pudding french toast! The bloody mary bar is also a must - their spicy salt rims are super tasty. It was my friends birthday and we asked what she could have since she is vegan and our server brought us over half full champagne glasses (there were 5 of us!) and did not even charge us since she couldn't eat any of the desserts! Phenomenal service.

For dinner a must check out night is half price wines on Monday. Our favorites were the scallops, spinach chickpea tapas, empanadas, and albondigas - yum!

My most recent trip to Barcelona was a total FAIL! Why, you ask? Well we showed up right at 11am when they open, which we have done a few times in the last couple of months post spin class. The best experience was last month when the charming and nice Argentinean manager was working. He definitely wasn't there this past visit! 
Here's the story:
We show up at 11am, sit down right away. I notice there is some staff meeting happening in a back room (we are sitting in the bar area.) Now around 11:10, no one has come by offering water or coffee, so I inquire if there was anyone to serve us? A waitress (who doesn't end up being our server) comes over and we order 4 coffees and 4 tapas. We weren't starving, and had to kill some time, so 1 tapa each and some coffee seemed reasonable for the 50 minutes we had allotted to spend there. (In hindsight when we sat down perhaps we could have indicated our time crunch, but our previous visits were super speedy so I didn't know...now I do!) 
We get our coffee, but it's now about 11:35 and no food. Nothing. I literally ordered a piece of toast with an egg on/in it. I flag down our waitress and her response is ""well some of the things you ordered take 45 minutes."" Umm, ok. ""Well can the things that are ready come out now?"" ""Oh, they come as they are ready."" Cut to: my head exploding with confusion combined with starvation. 
Unfortunately, two of us had to leave at 11:50, and not one item had arrived. I guess what peeved me even more was that when we left I saw a bunch of tables full of food (who had obviously gotten there after us, as we were the first people to arrive.) 
My 2 friends that stayed behind to eat my pan con huevo told me eventually the food showed up, along with profuse apologies and some complimentary tapas, which was a super nice gesture, but unfortunately I couldn't benefit from it! I do appreciate them trying to make it right with my friends, but I just cant understand a restaurant that has a published opening time just not being ready for people to arrive at that time!
{Side story: I was telling a friend about this brunch experience and she said she tried to go there Thursday night for dinner. Was quoted a wait time of 20-30 minutes, so they took her number and would call when a table was ready. No joke, they called 1.5 hours later!! Who does that!}

When you enter Barcelona the first thing you will be greated with is the beautiful & warm ambiance. You are instantly transported from DC's busy 14th street, to a rustic & welcoming restaurant. If you come during the right season, they have a beautiful outdoor sitting area with a wood fire place that fills the air with the most wonderful smokey smell. 

Food:
On my trip to Barcelona I ordered six tapas items, & one item from the cheese & meat menu. The food came out incredibly fast (5-10 min); although, we were warned that items off of the tapas menu, (such as paella), would take longer. We started our meal with the Jamon Serrao, which was delicious, but was nothing special. I will say this though before i get to the tapas, I love me some good bread, & it had been a good while since I had bread that tasted this good & fresh. 
Then the tapas dishes began to roll in:
1. Grilled Hanger Steak - was a little underwhelming. Was a little bland even with the black truffle vinaigrette. 
2. Smoked Whitefish Páté - this was amazing if I come back it would be just to buy this páté in bulk. The flavors just worked together really well and went perfectly with the warm bread.
3. Skate a la Plancha - was a little oily for my taste. Fish was also overdone and put off a weird texture. 
4. Crispy Calamari - completely lacked in flavor. Got tired of eating it after just one or two; although, the jalapeño & cilantro dipping sauce was really good.
5. Albondigas - these meat balls were wonderful and had a small heat kick for those who like spicy food. Were made with veal, pork, & lamb.
6. Spiced Beef Empanadas - were WAY too oily. When i picked then up could see the oil dripping off. Also they resembled more of a samosa than a empanada.

Desert: 
I'm going to make this easy for you. The flan was better than my moms flan, & my moms flan is the bomb.com (sorry mom).

Conclusion: It's defiantly an experience & a great date night restaurant. Prices aren't too terrible. However, if you are looking for a place where the food is going to blow you away, I would recommend some nearby places on 14th street. Or you could just come for the Páté!

I have mixed feelings about this place because the food and atmosphere is great but the service has been inconsistent and forgetful leaving me disappointed for both visits. 

The first time I came here was to celebrate a friend's birthday. I made the note on my reservation that I would like to do some sort of surprise birthday dessert, or have a candle. I even called an hour before the dinner, but they still forgot. I mentioned this on our way out, so they gave us a few wooden tokens to use the next time we visited. We decided we would come back because the food was good and we wanted to sit in the outside patio when it got warm (we originally visited in january so outdoors was obviously not an option)

Five months later, we came back to have dinner in the outside patio. There was a 30 minute wait, so we put our names down to sit outside and walked around.  We came back after 30 minutes and the host said we could sit down, but the open seats in the outside patio were going to a few parties who had made reservations and wanted to sit outside. The restaurant says there's no reservations for the outside patio, so we were confused as to why we couldn't sit outside and the reservations did. In addition, we had already waited 30 minutes and were originally told we could sit outside. Because we were hungry, we decided to get seated inside first, and asked the waiter and host to seat us outside when the next table opened up. 1/3 way into our dinner, our waiter changed. We noticed that we never got our bread (though they gave us the olive oil for it), and they never came back to us for sitting outside. 

We were pretty disappointed that we were not able to sit outside since we came specifically to sit outside. It was also a rare nice day in the district (not humid!), so we felt it was a wasted opportunity to come out of our way to eat here. We also felt like our request was neglected by the restaurant. 

For a place that's as popular as Barcelona (and on the pricier side), I'm surprised that they have been so forgetful both times I've been here. The food is great, but even if the food is great, if the service is not, then the overall experience suffers.

The only thing that saved the place in my mind was the very attentive service, Our server was everywhere at once, taking care of all of us with a smile on his face. He paced the food so we could make it to our next event. He worked through all the credit cards with ease. And he didn't bat an eye when a few more people showed up after we all sat down.

We had reservations for 9 pm and arrived on time. It was chaotic and hard to tell who was in line to put their name on the wait list and who had reservations. I eventually made it to the desk and a woman next to me checked in with a guy and I checked in with the woman next to him. She told me we could wait in the bar and since they had my cell, they would call me when our table was ready. We decided to wait outside and the Bar/Patio Manager offered us a sample of one of their drinks, which was good. After 30 minutes the woman who checked in at the same time as me is seated. After 45 minutes my sister asks the guy when we'll be seated and he says ""Your reservation was at 9, you're really late."" She told him we were there at 9 and points to the woman who checked us in. He told her sorry and that we would have to wait for him to find us a table. I didn't think he believed her, so I stopped the Bar Manager and asked him if he remembers giving us samples earlier and he said yes. I told him we had reservations for 9, he looks at his watch and says give me a minute. He was the one who got us seated, an hour and ten minutes after our reservation time. The woman I checked in with seated us and didn't even apologize. I'll give them another chance because the food, waitress and bar manager were awesome. They need to figure out a better way for customers to check-in though. A group waiting outside with us left because they did the same thing to them and they didn't want to wait anymore.

The last time I came here was on a Monday and we did not have reservations and was hoping to get a seat outside but the wait to sit outside was absurd so we ended up going somewhere else instead. First impression, I thought to myself this place must be really good. They're crazy busy on a Monday night? I have to come back to try this place next time. 

So I made reservations for a party of 4 on Sunday at 8:30 pm, since I've been eager to try this place for a while.  As we arrived, we were greeted and seated shortly after. 
Service was great, our server was very friendly and attentive to our needs. She checked up on our table every few minutes to make sure we were doing okay, and didn't need refills on our drinks. We ordered a pitcher of sangria w/white wine: sangria was mediocre. 
Moving on to the food; we ordered a few dishes to share between the 4 of us. What we ordered:

*Charcuterie + Cheese (meat & cheese): Pick 3:
-Jamon Serrano [Dry-Cured Spicy Ham], -Pecante [spicy pork sausage], and - Romao [Aged sheep's milk cheese, rosemary rind]: (Our server recommended this as her favorite from the selection of meat and cheese). I really appreciate her recommendations and I would have selected the same choices but I wasn't very impressed. 

*Tapas:
-Pan seared scallops: Average, Nothing Special
-Albondiagas [spicy meatballs]: Very Dry and didn't even finish the meatballs 
-Roasted Garlic Hummus Spread: Ordinary, plain, simple, Nothing Special
-Spicy Beef Empanadas: Very salty, Do Not Recommend
-Grilled Hanger Steak: 4 piece of small steak, over cook and dry. Do Not Recommend. 
-Patatas Bravas: Simple and bland, Do Not Recommend 
-Bone Marrow [two orders]: Recommend this. 

In a nutshell, I was very disappointed in the overall nature of the food items.  The only item that I was slightly excited about was the bone marrows we ordered. And that's the only item I would recommend trying at Barcelona, out of the many dishes we ordered. Maybe we just went on a bad day hopefully the food is usually better than that. I'm not opposed to coming back and giving this place a second shot. I do enjoy the ambiance and customer service they deliver and for that reason I'll have to come back next time and give it another chance before I can decide rather or not I hate or love this place.

However, the service was unusually curt, which is surprising for this caliber restaurant. We arrived for our reservation and the table wasn't ready. We ended up waiting 20+ minutes in the cramped entryway. We thought they might offer us a drink, and I asked the host - he told us we were free to order a drink, but it was clear that it would not be covered. When they finally seated us, they provided 2 different menus. My girlfriend's menu was an older version and so she had to use mine. This lack of foresight was quite unusual for this caliber place. The waitress was not very helpful, and never came by to ask us how the meal was going.

If you're looking for a fun, trendy place, I'd definitely recommend Barcelona, and we really enjoyed our night there. Despite the fun we had catching up with friends, the lack of quality service really takes away from the experience.

-Our 'seared' tuna dish was not only totally bland, but pretty much cooked.  Props to the manager for comping this dish, but even if it were properly cooked I don't know if it'd be very good.

-My favorite, the hangar steak with truffle sauce was about 1/2 the serving size that I remember and the same cost. It was 4 bites for $12

-And the real ringer:  4 shrimp, count 'em, 4, cost TEN DOLLARS. That's $2.50 for a shrimp the size of what you'd get in olive garden's shrimp scampi.  Not only that, but this dish used to come in a bubbling mass of oil and garlic and is now served dry on a plate. I've never felt so ripped off.

The good:
-Croquettes are still really awesome, cripsy out the outside, gooey on the inside.  
-Patatas Bravas are done really well here, crispy potatoes, creamy saucy (could be a tad spicier IMO)
-Crispy Brussel Sprouts were very tasty and the pickled onion was a surprising compliment
-Hubby *loved* his mushroom. They aren't my thing, so I passed.

652,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=yxqIkm7ZY1avyM_AK6qVKg,"I have been to many Tapas bars in my day and this one is definitely fun, but the food and the service is just okay in my opinion. 
We did come with a reservation for 9:15pm on a Friday night, we arrived 30 minutes early and sat at the crowded bar after letting them know we were there so they could come find us. Well over an hour later to be seated, so about 45 minutes past our reservation time we finally got a table, and of course this was also because we kept reminding them that we are there at the bar waiting. 
While we waited however the bartenders were very attentive and nice especially with a packed bar & standing room. The drinks were delicious! I definitely recommend the Summer Spring Cocktail (grapefruit vodka, grapefruit & lemon juices, some magic, and optional bitters). It was like a fancy grayhound and I drank at least 3 of them before we were seated. 
The Sangria either white or red is also pretty amazing. 
When we were finally seated and starving, we told the waiter we wanted to make it easy for him. So for a table of 6, we just ordered ALL of the Tapas (minus 3 things, No to the Squid, Chicken Liver, and Sheep Cheese). 
If you have never been to a Tapas bar it may surprise you that the food comes out as it is cooked so that it is fresh and hot. So one or two items at a time throughout the evening. And because we ordered pretty much the ENTIRE TAPAS MENU and an order of Vegetable Paella, we knew we were going to be there for awhile. The food came out one by one and we all split the items and shared family style. 
I didn't love anything and I didn't hate anything. The food wasn't bad, but it was okay. We also ended up with some of the Tapas we specifically said we didn't want and the waiter just said it was on them, nice.... but we specifically didn't want it to begin with so it went to waste. 
The service was just okay. The staff doesn't help out each other by answering a question or getting something simple for a table if it is not theirs. So we had a lot of waiting and repeatedly asking for simple things like water refill, balsamic to go with a the plate of oil that the server spilled all over the table, to order drinks, or questions. (Yes they were very busy when we got there but it did die down significantly within 2 hours, so it could have been better). Our server was a nice man who did make sure we were okay with everything when he did come to the table, and apologize for forgetting things we asked for already. 
One nice thing was they basically brought their entire dessert tray out (even though we were too full to eat any of it) with candles for my friends birthday. That was nice, but more wasted food. A simple cupcake for the bday girl would have been enough. But it was very sweet of them. 

Overall the place served its purpose for a fun night out of good drinks, lots of food, and yummy dessert for a bday dinner. But I will probably not go back in the future.

Also, my friend and I wanted a pitcher of sangria but didn't know if we wanted the original or other kind. The server was kind enough to give us a taste of each - thank goodness because the ""not original"" one (I forgot what it was called) was too lavender for me. Yes, I said lavender.

On to the tapas. My fave items are always fresh and simple, so I loved the beet salad and the hamachi. My least fave was the chorizo with fig. The chorizo was just ok and the fig was way too sweet for it. My second least fave were the croquettes. They were cute, crisp, and gooey inside, which most peeps would like.

My wife drank only two glasses because she said it didn't taste very good. Since I couldn't taste any alcohol I casually finished off the pitcher. I normally can feel two glasses of wine, but after drinking 5-6 glasses of this sangria I noticed no effects.

1. Their reservations are a mess, Possibly the worst reservation experience I've had EVER. Reservation was at 7:00 pm, I arrived at 6:50 and we waited for an hour  and five minutes to be seated. Only when we told them we were leaving were we seated. Meanwhile people that arrived later than us were seated. The only reason why we didn't leave earlier is because I really can't walk far. 
2. We were served in a matter of 30 minutes and the we waited and waited for another 30 mns for dessert, eventually we gave up and asked for the check. So we were brought dessert. So overall we waited around for 1.5 hrs at least for a meal that was NOT extraordinary. 
So the 3 stars are for, 1. giving free drinks and an appetizer for free while we waited. 2. Giving me a chair because I can't stand for long while I waited for an hr to be taken to my table. 3. The food is decent but NOT worth the drama. 
So I can't recommend this restaurant based on the reservations. When I make a reservation I do expect to be seated within 15 mins of my arrival.

I also tried a wonderful, seasonal dish where the meat was so tender, it fell right off the bone. This is one of the few moments where I wish I had been an obnoxious Millennial and taken a photo for this Yelp review!

On the downside, I do think service was scattered. When I first sat down in the outdoor area, waiting for my party, it took a while to get water much less to have someone take an initial drink/food order. We eventually ended up moving indoors, and to her credit, the waitress was eager and friendly. However, her harried nature revealed that Thursdays can be quite busy at Barcelona! People were jockeying for tables by the bar, and as soon as we got up to leave, it looked like people were about to pull out their shanks to get our seats.

So this is my second time eating at Barcelona, and what a night it was. It's a 45 min wait once we put our name down, no complaints since it's a popular place. After 45 mins, they let us know our table is ready, annddd we go to the front to find out they have given our table to someone else. They said they were really sorry and will sit us down for when the next table is available with some tapas on the house. Ok, this was fine, they were able to more than make up for this with some charcuterie, and shishito peppers, both were really delicious.

I believe the age of Yelp has dawned on businesses that even the smallest of bad experiences can result in a bad review of their establishment, and with enough bad reviews, shutter their business, so they really go out of their way to make sure no one has a bad experience. I really felt that here. 

So we ordered the rockfish tapas, spinach and chickpeas salad, and mussels. The food here was good, but not great. I did like the mussels in the spicy tomato sauce, however. It had nice big garlic cloves and a nice spicy kick to it, but a gripe was the mussels were tiny. Good sauce, small mussels basically. We ate only about a quarter of the chickpeas salad as well, this is a dish you would find in a casual kabob joint, not one I enjoyed at a nice sit down restaurant like here. You can find better food at other restaurants on 14th street, but the ambiance and atmosphere is definitely one of the best.

So we finished our meal, well everything except the spinach-chickpeas salad. The waiter noticed it, and asked us how it was. We were honest and just said we didn't like it. I believe they were still trying to make up from the earlier mix up, or maybe they were just being nice, but the guy said he didn't want us to pay for the spinach-chickpeas salad if we didn't enjoy it, and said it was on the house. At this point, me and my brother were really impressed by the service and how they were trying to recover from the earlier situation, the manager and our server really went above and beyond what they needed to do to make us happy. 

Then, next to to our table, the waiter (not the one serving us) mishandles a wine glass and drops it on the table next to ours, the cup pointed right towards me when hitting the table, and red wine splashes all over me (and just me). Mind you, I was wearing a brand new shirt for the first time that I just bought at Nordstrom a few days ago at an early access sale. Usually I just go casual, but I thought to myself, why not wear my new shirt I just bought, what's the point of buying it if I'm not going to wear it. Well lo and behold, red wine all over my new shirt that I really liked. 

The manager was horrified when this happened, and brought over a soda water for me to dab on my shirt. So there I was, middle of Barcelona, drenching half of my shirt in soda water hoping the stains don't stick. I did what I normally do in these situations, I bursted out laughing hard as hell. The whole thing was just funny as hell to me, then my brother laughed hard as hell too, and we both just sat there laughing while I was drenching my shirt in soda water. The meal on the house, but my shirt costs double the meal. The manager did give me a card and told me to contact her, to which I have. Things happen so, I'm not giving this place a bad review because of an accident. The food was decent, and the decor was nice, I would say the food is 3 stars, and the decor is 4 stars, while the service is 5 stars (sans waiter splashing wine on me).

Unfortunately, there was an hour and a half wait to sit outside (at 4:30pm?!?!), but we were seated inside, relatively close to the patio, so were still able to enjoy some sun. We asked for a table for 3, since we had one other person joining us, but instead were given a table for 2. We decided not to do anything about it just yet since our party had not yet arrived. Luckily, the group sitting next to us at a table for 4 were just finishing up. We asked our waitress if it would be ok if we slid over once the table was cleaned, and she said that it wouldn't be a problem. 

We ordered a bottle of prosecco, but unfortunately, when we received it, it was incredibly warm. The person who brought us the bottle (who wasn't our server) seemed a bit shock that we wanted to send it back. He kind of didn't know what to do, but I'm sorry, when you're paying $45 for something, it needs to be good. We then had another person come to our table to let us know that their cooler had broken, and they didn't realize. They were putting our bottle on ice behind the bar, and that they were going to comp us another bottle for free. That was incredibly nice of them, and fair -- the bottle that they gave us was $48, so comparable to what we had ordered. After that, someone else came to visit our table. I think the manager? He then apologized for the mishap and told us that we also couldn't sit at our new table. We then explained what had happened, and that our waitress let us know it'd be fine to move. He then said that they were booked solid til 11pm -- I guess trying to make us feel bad? But, there were at least 8 tables behind us that were open. Also, it was 5pm. I understand that people make reservations, but we were seated upon walking in without a reservation. You can't reserve your entire restaurant! A few minutes later, my husband arrived, completing our party of 3. We also had our free bottle of cava, which was delicious. 

We ordered the trout pate, two orders of the shrimp (the ones cooked in the garlic oil), and some serrano ham. When we finished our free bottle, they brought a brand new bottle of the first prosecco that we had ordered and put it on ice at the table. We were gone by 7:30, and there were still some empty tables.

All in all, it was an interesting experience. I've been to their location in Stamford, and we really enjoyed the food. Everything that we ordered yesterday was delicious, and I highly recommend the trout pate. It's the perfect blend of smokey and fishy and tasted amazing on their hot crusty bread. It was very nice of them to comp us a bottle of cava, but the experience as a whole was just kind of weird and awkward and marred by our original ""prosecco waiter"" not knowing what to do when we sent the first bottle back.

We decided the sangria (red, traditional) tasted similar to a melted popsicle. Although melted popsicle is tasty in its own right, and the pitcher was quite huge for $26, it wasn't quite what I expected from a popular wine bar.

Next, we ordered the Crispy skate wing, Spinach-chickpea cazuela, and Albongidas (spiced meatballs). The skate was by far the best, although it was merely fried white fish with tasteless capers and hazelnuts. The spinach chickpea dish was lacking on flavor and not as good as a similar dish at your local Indian restaurant. We didn't finish it. Lastly, the meatballs were somewhat dry and had some strange spicing that was not quite right. They were served in a plain tomato sauce. We wondered if frozen meatballs might be a slight improvement over these. We ordered 2 of these dishes on recommendation from our server, and we wondered if there weren't better options hiding on the menu. 

At one point, we were the only ones on the patio (we had arrived at 4:30pm) and a manager wandered by saying ""you're the only ones out here so I guess I'll say hello"". And wandered off before we could react.

Plus, it's in a neighborhood that I visit often.  I've only sat at the bar for happy hour, but it's not on my dinner radar, so I'll probably only return for happy hour.

My overall rating is probably 3.5 stars, but I can't round up to four stars.  I do love the scene-a variety of ages, but all well-dressed and professional in hip setting.  Lighting is dim, but not too dark that you cannot see what you are eating.  Al fresco dining is available year round due to heat lamps, and I have to admit, that's a bit of a draw.  Staff was friendly and welcoming and not at all pretentious.
 
As for food and drink, it was mixed.  One of the things I like about tapas restaurants is the sangria, and while their sangria was tasty, it was not strong.  And that's a big issue for me.  I had two glasses and did not even feel a slight buzz.  However, I did have rosé that I enjoyed.  For food, we ordered the following:

- Pork belly
- Whipped sheep's cheese
- Cucumber salad 
- Spinach-chickpea cazuela
- Spicy eggplant caponata 
- Albondigas (did not try)
- Potato tortilla (did not try)

All were on the happy hour menu (which is $2-$3 tapas and $5 wine), except the pork belly.  The pork belly was my favorite and it was extremely tender with nice layers of fat.  The other two items I liked were the cucumber salad and the whipped sheep's cheese.  The eggplant was not spicy and the spinach-chickpea dish just did not wow me.  The bread is delicious and addictive.  So there were some wins, and overall, I like Barcelona.

When we checked in at 8:17 they said they were running about 15 minutes behind. We waited out on the patio until 8:30.   When I checked in again they again said they were running behind and it would be a bit longer.  Seeing the disappointment on my face the manager approached us to offer free cava. We continued to wait until 9:00!!!  They tried to apologize for our wait by offering the first round of drinks on house, which was nice but once we finally got a seat it seemed like they were rushing. They barely have us time to look at the drink menu and then it seemed like we were rushed to look at the menu.   While the food was simply amazing and the staff were generally nice the hostess stand was poorly managed as well as the timing of our meal.

Update:

Once my guest and I were finally seated I asked to speak with a manager. I told him that I was traveling from out of town and was very disappointed with how my reservation was handled. He apologized and told me that he would make sure that the rest of my experience there would be up to my expectations. He was correct. For starters he brought us glasses of champagne. Our waiters suggested some really great dishes and a pitcher of sangria. All of the dishes were AMAZING!! Also, to my surprise, a large amount of money was taken off our final bill.

834,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=jzV56K7A_mx3y3Eh7YG26g,"If I was only rating Barcelona on food, they would get 4 stars. But unfortunately my group of six had a little problem when we went to Barcelona for a late night dinner this week. Namely the waiter, while opening a bottle of red wine, sprayed my friend with the red wine. Not a big spill, but lots of little red dots all over his blue shirt. 

The waiter was incredibly apologetic, and immediately went to get a manager and some seltzer water--exactly what he should do. The manager came right over, again great response. The problem was that the manager's only peace offering was to tell my friend to send the restaurant his dry cleaning bill. Womp womp.

I agree that dry cleaning should always be offered in that situation, but the thing is, how many people actually get around to doing that? (My friend, in fact, lives in New York.) How many people keep their dry cleaning receipt, mail it to the restaurant, and then what, get a check in the mail for $5.45? And what about when the red wine doesn't come out? Is he supposed to ask you to pay for the shirt? NO! That would be obnoxious! Accidents happen. As a 14-year-old waitress, I once spilled hot coffee on an old lady in a retirement home where I worked in the dining room. I was way worse than our waiter! 

I think the waiter did the best he could with the situation. He apologized profusely and took the problem to management. But I think that the manager should have given my friend some form of more immediate compensation that didn't involve him having to go through the trouble of submitting receipts. I'm not even saying it needs to be something big, send over a free dessert, it will cost you less than the dry cleaning anyway! Just do something to show you acknowledge your customer just sacrificed a shirt to their dining experience at your restaurant. Come on, we all know he's probably not sending you that dry cleaning bill. 

All that being said, I really enjoyed the food at Barcelona. Tapas restaurants are best enjoyed with a bigger group (so you can try more!), and Barcelona was no exception. 

I loved almost all of the dishes, but especially:
--Chorizo w/ Sweet and Sour Figs
--Sautéed Skate Wing (with a nice little spicy kick to it!)
--Grilled Hanger Steak (nice and smoky)
--Albondigas (meatball perfection, which is harder to find than one might expect)
--Spiced Beef Empanadas 
--Spicy Eggplant Caponata 
--Morcilla & Rose Finn Apple Potatoes (with a super tasty saffron sauce, that totally beat out the Patatas Bravas more traditional salsa and aioli)
--All the warm, fresh, crusty bread that could be used to soak up the juices from the other dishes!

A few other people at the table loved the Tripe and Blood Sausage so much that they ordered a second round. Although the flavors were great, I couldn't quite get over the texture issue myself. 

Finally, and sort of ironically, the bottles of wine are half off on Monday nights!

The hosts do not use a computer system for reservations and had simply written down all of their reservations and from the looks of the list, hosts had squeezed in names where ever they could find a space to write them. When we finally did get a table we were escorted outside...in mid-March. The temperature was around 50 degrees. Yes, there were blankets and heaters but one would think that when it was that cold you would be asked if you were ok with being seated outside.

Barcelona is solidly three stars, and mainly for the service and decor. This place is posh looking,  yo. I love the interior and the patio is beautifully modern. 

My girl Lu and I met here for brunch this past Sunday at 12:45. We were promptly seated by friendly staff and immediately had our drink orders in. Staff was patient with us as we spent more time gabbing and talking shit than perusing the menu.

We ordered the following:

1) Greek yogurt and granola tapas
2) Steak and Eggs (hangar steak with chimichurri, two sunny side up eggs, and potatoes)
3) Honey Lavender pancakes

Here's where Barcelona goes mediocre, which is pretty concerning for a restaurant; the food.
The granola tapas was perfectly adequate, if very, very small. Yogurt was fresh and drizzled with a fair amount of honey as well as topped with dried cranberries, some fresh raspberries and blueberries, and what they called granola but was really more a muesli. A-Ok. 

The steak and eggs were a disappointment. We paid $19.50 for this meal, ladies and gents. For that price I'm expecting at the very least, four ounces of steak. Steak for this was practically shaved it was so thin, and served in six small little medallions. My skilled eye estimated this at around 1.5 oz of steak. Ugh. Eggs were cooked perfectly, but the potatoes were drowning in oil. 

The pancakes were a disaster. We actually sent the first round back because as I gently stated to the waiter, ""Um, these have absolutely no flavor to them"". Our second round was not much better. I did not detect a single hint of lavender, and they were woefully flat and in need of some serious baking powder. The pancakes are drizzled with honey and no syrup is provided so be prepared for some super dry bites and some sickeningly sweet ones. These were a huge disappointment.

Food is a solid two-three, service was a solid three. Our waiters were friendly and our water and coffee were consistently refilled, but that can't make up for just basic, not so great food. I will likely take my money elsewhere.

I got there before 7 with my girlfriend tonight and it was PACKED. We went up to leave our name and the host was very weird about it and said it would be better for us to wait for a first come, first serve table. Once I badgered him a little he finally put our name down. We waited by the bar with a few sangrias for about a half hour and a table finally opened up (there were three women there who had ordered waters and one sangria). Finally, after two sangrias in, we ordered the seafood paella (took about a half hour to cook) and four tapas plates. Too much for two people, we would've been fine with just the four small plates and two sangrias. 

Where the service lacked, the food made up for. We loved all the tapas include:

-Mushrooms and herbed goat cheese in a balsamic reduction
-Patatas bravas (salsa brava and garlic aioli)
-Romao (Rosemary cured firm sheep's cheese)

Our reservations were for 8:30 pm - I arrived slightly before him and it was incredibly crowded so I skipped trying to fight the crowd to get a drink at the bar.

I'm not sure why we were made to wait, but it would have been nice to have gotten a slight explanation.

We shared a really good bottle of Albarino, and instead of dessert my boyfriend had an old fashioned and I had a nice glass of Malbec. Food wise, we ordered manchego, patatas bravas, potato tortilla, chicken and jamon croquettes, gambas al ajillo, scallops, and meatballs. The portions were all very small, even by small plates/tapas standards. The only dish that was the ""right"" size to me was the patatas bravas. If you have more than two people and all want to try a dish, you will need to order multiple of it. The gambas and scallops were incredibly small. I am an experienced tapas eater, and was shocked at how small those two dishes were. However I will say that the scallops were cooked to absolute perfection - they just melted in my mouth. The chicken and jamon croquettes were my favorite dish of the evening, just very flavorful and a joy to eat. For our drinks and food, our bill came to around $130 before tip.

Firstly, the bartenders are painfully slow. Absurdly slow, considering how much wine and beer is ordered.  There is a definite preference for females at this establishment.

The atmosphere was nothing special, just a dark bar/dining restaurant with lots of people.  There was a lot of chitter chatter, I don't remember hearing any music in the background, so I am assuming there wasn't any.  The outdoor seating looked pretty neat, but it was too cold for my blood.  

Starting off with the drinks, I noted that someone on YELP recommended the bourbon spice rack.  I got it and was disappointed.  The drink tasted like old ladies perfume and was the size of a rinse cup you use to brush your teeth.  I didn't really taste any alcohol in it, nor did I feel anything, at all.  After that disappointment, I decided to go back to my tried and true, Johnny Black.  Unfortunately, they didn't have that, and the waitress said the closest thing was Jameson, ahh well.  My friend ordered white wine.  She wasn't sure what kind she wanted so the waitress was kind enough to bring out three different samples, and she chose her favorite.  The only problem was that the wine glasses had an odor to them; an odor as if they had been in a stale dishwasher.  It really killed the taste of the wine.

The food was a mix of good and bad.  The mushroom with goat cheese was excellent, as was the hanger steak, I highly recommend both of them.  The rest was disappointing.  The calamari, which was recommended, tasted like something I could get a TGIFridays.  A potato dish was also recommend, the menu read fried potatoes with garlic aioli, which in actuality are cubed potatoes with ketchup and mayonnaise.  It tasted like McDonalds if you closed your eyes and chewed.  Also, the sea bass tasted like warm shoe sole, no flavor at all, just rubbery.  

All in all, this restaurant disappointed me after all the hype.  There was a mixture of good and bad, but I would not dine here again.  The true shining point of this restaurant was the service, which was impeccable.  I saw that in multiple reviews and I completely agree.  They have truly trained the wait staff to outperform.

I had never been but heard good things so we figured we'd try the place. We arrived there a few minutes before our reservation (I mean like 2 or 3 minutes) and I went to see the hostess to ""check in"". There were a few other people waiting to put their names in, and the place was packed! Most of the tables outside were full and the bar area was still crowded from the happy hour crowd. I spoke with the waitress and she said it would just be a few minutes and then she would call/text me. So, we went to the bar and ordered a round of beers while we waited.

A server came around after about 10 minutes and offered us appetizers they were passing around for people waiting and in the bar area. It was awesome! But after another 10 or so minutes, I got antsy and went to see the hostess again. She said they were unexpectedly busy and the table would be just a little bit longer. I was a bit annoyed, given that we had made reservations and were already waiting for 20 minutes, but things happen so we figured we'd grab a second beer and hangout. 

After another 15 minutes, I went back to the hostess who was not at the stand, and waited. When she returned, she assured me that we would be sat ""right away"". She smiled and was very kind, but it was starting to seem a bit patronizing. After waiting for another 30 minutes (now we were 1 hour past our original reservation, and starving), I went back to the hostess stand, pointed to an open table on the patio, and said that I hoped that was our table. She quickly realized that this was ridiculous, grabbed three menus and led us to a table outside. She apologized over and over and said they would ""take care of us"". I didn't know what that meant but I figured I'd let them try and win back our good favor. 

The waiter was prompt and service was good. He took our orders right away, answered questions about the menu, and checked on us from time to time. The food was excellent, although, after all that, they forgot to bring us one of the tapas we had ordered. The waiter apologized and took the plate off of our receipt. They also knocked off about $16 for the ""Long Wait"" (which is clearly a button on their register and a bit unsettling ... does this happen that often? Or is it just normal for POS systems at restaurants?).

Anyway, I would give Barcelona 4 stars if they honored their own reservations. I understand having to wait a few minutes even if you have reservations, but an hour is ridiculous. The food and overall service and atmosphere earned them some stars in my opinion, especially if this was a rare occurrence (I hope so!).

We did about 12 tapas between 6 of us and it was more than enough and amazing. The ambiance is great - we were seated outside on a rather chilly Oct night but between the heaters, the fireplace, and blankets we couldn't complain. After my friends notified the waiter that it was my birthday, they did give us a lovely dessert and shots on the house. Now the not so good - our reservation was for 7:30. We did not get seated until around 8:20-8:25. I'll give them credit - they brought over snacks and a round of sangria but an almost hour wait with a reservation is kind of nuts. When we considered going elsewhere, the manager told my friend ""Don't worry, we'll take care of you. You'll have a great time,"" which we took to mean maybe some free drinks or a discounted tab. Well, that didn't happen (maybe wishful thinking on our part) - nothing was discounted or provided outside of the birthday surprise which my friend asked for (and then had to remind them about after we sat after our meal for 20 mins). Our waiter forgot one of our dishes and when we followed up about it with the manager (he stopped by to see how it went) he also seemed to forget. It wasn't until we asked another waiter did it turn out that the original order was never put in. If the food (and the red wine sangria) wasn't so good, I would have not considered coming back.

Every time I come in (even with reservations) the staff who table individuals right at the door have treated guests like crap.  I understand that restaurants are busy and that you have a very long wait, and yes I really don't mind going to the bar area to wait to be seated, but the manner in which the staff direct guests to the area has been nothing but snooty, high-nosed, and in drastic-need of replacement.  I always hope to see the manager there (the shorter guy with the beard) who ALWAYS ALWAYS treats us with respect and courtesy which is what I have experience with of this restaurant from CT.  There is a very clear difference in the way the manager treats the guests coming in waiting in line vs those who flip that front page back on their clipboard to tell you have 2 hours to wait.  I would urge everyone who reads this post to note these differences too as this has occurred to me on more than one occasion where the front staff will blatantly say, ""oh, we have an hour and 45 minute wait, you can wait by the bar"" while the manager would willingly come up and ask if we've been helped and he'll see if there's anything he can do.  If not, that's fine, it's really just the manner in which you treat your guests that make guests feel like they're in an appropriate dining establishment.

The lamb (?) dish was good, and the bread was good; the brussels sprouts were ok, and the octopus dish was a miss. The octopus dish could be enhanced with more multidimensional flavor (it falls flat)-- the octopus and celery should also be cut differently to bring out more texture as well.

The host informed us that due to the restaurant's popularity they don't allow indoor/outdoor preference, but the wait would be about an hour. We were starving by that point so decided to pass. However, the next night we ate a late afternoon snack in preparation for having to wait at this place (since they only take reservations for before 6 pm). We figured since the place seemed  to have a pretty significant fan club that it would be worth the wait. So we waited an hour and a half at least. We noticed some tables clearing outside in the patio so my husband approached the hostess to ask her if we could possibly get a table out there. Before even being able to ask her about sitting outside, she asked him to grab me and said our table was ready, making it apparent she had forgotten about us. I asked her if it was possible to sit outside as there were open tables and she said there were people ahead of us that were waiting for those. But wait a minute, last night we were informed no preference was given for indoor or outdoor. I guess unless maybe you slip the hostess money? We were seriously put off by that, and from that point on we wanted to either be blown away or we weren't going to be happy.

Our service here was pretty great I will say however. He made awesome suggestions, was efficient and friendly, and took great care of us.

1539,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=r89Auz4GkTtWZcY2k2_jlQ,"Occasion: Birthday dinner for a party of 6

First take: I was surprised to see this restaurant only half full on a Friday evening, but still excited to visit a spot on my list of must trys in DC. We were greeted warmly by the hosts and also our first waiter, a woman wearing fabulous red lipstick whose name I can't quite remember. The restaurant itself looks really cool -- there's a dark Art Deco vibe of sorts with whimsical lights and paintings where you least expect them. 

Food: 1) We started off with the Chef's Cheese and Charcuterie Board which was good, although not great. The menu doesn't tell you the cuts of meat and cheese beforehand and it ended up being a selection I felt we could have gotten at a restaurant with ""$$"" rather than ""$$$""--I'm also tempted to say the bread included was the best part. When it first came out I echoed the feelings of other Yelpers in regards to way too small portion sizes. Thankfully, their complementary flatbread crackers and delightful whipped butter made up for this first course disappointment. 

2) I absolutely loved my main course of Pekin Duck. It ranks among the best duck I've ever had--perfectly tender and paired well with wild black rice for a juicy/crunchy sensation in each bite. I'm so pleased that our first waiter recommended the dish to me. The potato gnocchi that I tried off of two other friends' plates was also a dish that I'd reorder in a heartbeat. Another great dish was the risotto fries, although I wish they maintained the risotto texture inside the fried exterior. I would order each of these three plates again. 

3) The problem arises from our second waiter, a male who I won't name. I'm not sure why two different servers worked our table, especially since they seemed not to be working together--for example, we were asked about ordering drinks twice. This second waiter was continuously impatient, and almost acted like our table was unworthy of his service. When a friend ordered Oxtail Agnolotti, she asked specifically what ""agnolotti"" entailed. This waiter simply said it was a type of pasta, implying that the oxtail was served with this pasta. She was shocked to receive her entree and find that by ""pasta"" the waiter meant ""dumplings"" filled with oxtail (please see photo for reference). She was unhappy and barely touching her meal, so I flagged down the waiter to alert him of the misunderstanding. Rather than apologizing, he rudely said ""I told you what it was."" After I explained he had said it was pasta, didn't specify that it was a dumpling, and that my friend didn't want to eat it, he asked what she wanted instead with annoyance. 

Bottom line: I completely get that it's hard for a waiter to justify a wasted plate to the kitchen, but the chef himself came to our table with the new dish she ordered (gnocchi) to apologize. Unfortunately, the waiter's attitude didn't end there. As we were discussing how to split the check he stood by our table and suddenly interrupted ""don't you all have Venmo?"" I was shocked and asked him to give us a few moments. We paid and when another staff member brought our check, I asked her to bring over the manager.  I told the manager that I purposely spoke to her after paying so that she didn't assume we were trying to get a free meal. But I expressed to her that this waiter's behavior was wholly inappropriate. She apologized and asked if we'd like free desserts or a free round of drinks, but at that point we just wanted to leave. As we were packing up and I was writing a note on the receipt, the waiter had the audacity to return and tell us ""write whatever you want, I don't care.""

At this point I was very upset. I spotted the manager on my way out and told her that what I had been writing on the receipt was a 10% gratuity in place of the 20% the restaurant automatically included because I felt only the first waiter deserved it and I wanted it to go only to her. The manager assured me they'd be taking off the added gratuity in full in light of the dining experience we had. 

She didn't end up following through on this, but did refund half of the gratuity. I wasn't going to write a review at all but figured I should speak out on the off chance this waiter tries something like this again or tends to behave this way only to a certain type of guest.

The vibe is mature and romantic and it's situated conveniently right across from the metro. The wine selection was extensive and the sommelier was extremely nice and helpful. The wine menu is organized by locations where the wines are produced. If you're a wino this is a must stop. As for the food, it was well-crafted but the portion sizes are simply too small for the price point. We started with the whipped goat cheese flatbread because it sounded like the most shareable appetizer for a party of 4... it was a deconstructed flatbread, though, and only came with 4 toasted triangles of pita. It was delicious and creamy with a nice salad to put atop the pieces, but we each could only have one small piece. 

For my entree, I had the pekin duck with rhubarb and raspberries-- it was perfectly cooked and the sauce was a perfect sweet-toned accompaniment, but it was finished in a few bites. I tried a bite of the potato gnocchi with asparagus and mushrooms and have to admit it was delicious and pillowy and rich. The pork chop was the only normal sized entree and was perfectly cooked. But it lacked flavor and needed a brighter sauce to give it some depth. It was served with a way-too-spicy version of radish kimchi. 

Overall the restaurant is nice and the food was well prepared. But the portions were just too small to justify returning for those prices (think $30-range for entrees).

Items I've Had During Lunch Crush: 

Sauteed Potato Gnocchi- it's earthy rich, more than fulfilling but it's lack of acidity makes its richness a bit monotonous, so grab a lemon wedge and give it a spritz and it'll be perfect.

Lamb Pasta Dish- was tasty, but small and a little skimp on the lamb. Which influenced me to order the chickpea fries as well, which then became more than enough. The fries were beautiful plated and tasty.

Lemon Cream Tart - this was inedible. This should've have been a red flag. Basil ice cream was fine, but the meringue and cookie/breading underneath were shockingly disappointing.

So with the ups and downs of certain dishes, I still chose to have dinner here one night based solely off of the gnocchi, because it was well executed.

We ordered:Sauteed Potato Gnocchi, Scallops a la Michel Richard, Lobster Bisque, two drinks: Blue Train Special and Tequila Cider Buck.

The drinks were fine, not great but not bad- just drinks really.

Sauteed Potato Gnocchi: It was as tasty as I remember, but at $25 for the same serving size and just for a bowl of potatoes and flour, not really worth it.

Scallops a la Michel Richard w/ $20 added shaved truffle: was lackluster, the scallops were overcooked and tough. I was expecting crispy and moist scallops and got an overworked piece of protein from the sea. Atop a bed of probably three halved and charred brussel sprouts and leeks with a vincotto that didn't lift, accent, or ascend any part of the dish.

Lobster Bisque: this dish arrived beautifully presented. The bisque itself is delicious. The items placed in the bisque: the pieces of lobster were tough, the apple was julienne into strips that made eating the bisque a bit clumsy and difficult.

Once I ordered the bisque I came to the epiphany that Proof focuses more on presentation than overall taste. Everything for the most part was good looking and up-to-par with restaurants in DC, but a lot of dishes fell flat taste-wise. Dishes weren't as flavorful as expected, and certain items like the scallops and lobster were not shown the respect they needed in order to be the star of any of the two dishes.

Sidenote: Before having dinner at Proof I would've given this restaurant a solid 3.5-4 for lunch. However, after experiencing this dinner based on price, portion size and execution it's a 2.5 out of 5. A 'Rasika', 'Zaytinya', or 'Oyamel' would've been worth a $100+ plus tab.

We were seated in a large booth towards the back of the restaurant (near the cheese/charcuterie counter), which was perfect. Loved the ambience, and we were able to hear each other talk - always a bonus. Our server started out just fine - pleasant, in fact. He made a few recommendations, returned promptly with our drinks, and checked in periodically throughout the meal. We started with a truffle hazelnut salami and 3 cheeses (Leonora, Cashel blue, and a firm Wisconsin cheddar) - loved all of this and the bread + accompaniments. As a cheese lover, this was a serious highlight. Paired with a glass of the cab, it was heaven. For the main course, we opted for the Berkshire pork chop (delicious, cooked perfectly), gnocchi (pillowy, flavorful, just YUM) and brussel sprouts. We enjoyed everything and were stuffed, so decided to forego dessert. 

By this time we were sipping our draft beers and chatting, having asked our server for the bill but obviously not in a rush. He brings it back, and my husband puts in his credit card and a voucher for a $20 open table credit. Server returns and literally tosses the bill holder onto the table and leaves - not so much as a smile or any eye contact, let alone a ""thanks for coming!"" or ""hope to see you again."" I'm pretty sure my mouth drops open at this point, as hubby and I stare at each other in confusion. We finish our beers, and the server comes by again - this time aggressively snatching the empty glasses and leaving without a word. Was he pissed that we didn't order dessert? Or had the audacity to use a well-earned open table credit? Our bill was almost $150, so not exactly something to sneeze at. Of course we tipped on the original amount pre-discount, though looking back I wish we hadn't. No idea what happened to cause the 360 degree shift in attitude, but nothing warrants this kind of behavior. It was truly bizarre.

I believe the server said that he was their wine manager, which was fine, but for someone whose livelihood is based on wine, I would expect some more excitement, or even a little energy.

The appetizers are an individual size, so if you plan on sharing, order multiple. We ordered four appetizers for a party of four. The dinner options were a good size and everyone seemed satisfied. The apps seemed to have a lot of Asian flavors incorporated and entrées more of a middle eastern/Mediterranean flare, which I enjoyed. 

Overall, this was just a dinner, not an experience. I would go back, but probably just sit at the bar again.

I visited Proof DC on Friday, May 5, 2017 for my first wedding anniversary! My husband and I had an 8 o'clock reservation. The hostess was efficient, if not friendly. We were seated at a table with a window view which I liked very much but then I realized that my pet peeve was there to torment me...a rocky table. If you manage a restaurant, please please check for uneven tables! It drives me nuts! 

Anyway, our waiter was okay, another not-overly-friendly employee. He served us our first round of drinks and then disappeared. Another gentleman began serving us and we eventually realized that the first guy had gone home without telling us! Rude much? 

My husband and I shared the ahi tuna tartar appetizer, very decent. My husband had the salmon and I had the duck. Both of our meals were pretty excellent. My one gripe about my meal is with this slaw concoction they serve with the duck, it's basically inedible, totally lacking in flavor aside from bitterness; other than that the cocktails were on point and the cab I had was out of sight!

There was an older, white crowd at Proof when we went. The overall mood is quiet and subdued. Definitely not a hip place I'd want to take my girlfriends but they're serving solid food and wine.

My friend ordered a flatbread, while I ordered the ahi tuna appetizer.  A bit overpriced for an appetizer, considering it wasn't a big portion, but still tasty.  

The service is awful.  Several people were standing around without helping us when we were sitting right in front of them.  When we first entered the restaurant, no one was there to greet us for several minutes.  Very strange.

We bought what is normally a $15 bottle of wine for $50, and it was one of the cheapest available bottles (seriously, there was a whole page of wines priced $2000+).  Wine by the glass was about $15 each (less for a 2oz sample, and more for a heavier pour).  The wine menu was really extensive, and took some time to work through.

I really recommend the Sticky Toffee Pudding Cake, it was probably one of the best deserts I have ever had.  All our food was great, and while the portions are small for the price, they were cooked to perfection.  The Spicy Meatball appetizer was great, as well as the Honey Goat Cheese flatbread.

Really, my only complaint was with the service.  While the waitress was attentive in making sure our wine glasses were always full, she wasn't overly personable or helpful.  I originally chalked this up to being a lower keep restaurant where the wait staff perhaps try not to interfere with your dining experience, but then I heard the waitress from a nearby table, and I was actually jealous.  She was so helpful in picking out meals, wines, cheeses, etc.  She gave several recommendations and I could tell the couple dining really appreciated it.  We had let our waitress know it was out first time, and I would have loved some extra attention and guidance. As I said before, the wine menu was really extensive (several pages long), and we kinda felt thrown to the wind in trying to pick something out. 

Overall, if you love wine and fancy dining, this is a great place in the city.  Its right beside the China Town metro stop on the Red Line, but my husband and I just got off at Metro Center and walked.  It was only about 3 blocks or so. Good option if you need to be on the Blue, Orange, or Silver lines and don't want to have to deal with switching lines at the next stop.

Food: 3.5 Stars (Gnocchi deserves a 5 star though!)

I took my mom and siblings here Sunday night to celebrate their birthdays (April babies). I always like taking them to a nice restaurant each year for their birthdays since we hardly do that as a family. I came across Proof on yelp and thought it'd be the perfect spot. Proof is located right next to the Verizon Center and is fairly easy to find. They have valet for $12 with validation. 

From the beginning, the service was just A-OK. Not terrible, but nothing spectacular that you'd sort of expect from a nice, pricey restaurant. The hostess was meh - didn't greet me until I greeted her. The server didn't really introduce himself. Kind of just took our drink order and then waited around until we were ready to order our food. I was a bit confused at first whether he was our server or the bus boy since he stayed so quiet. Oh and the place was pretty much dead, so the lack of service isn't because they were busy. There were about 3 other parties there when we arrived. 

Now, for the food:

Sautéed Potato Gnocchi w/ Asparagus, Ramps, & Wild Mushrooms: DELICIOUS. This was seriously everyone's favorite part of the meal. The gnocchi was creamy, but had the nice texture on the outside from being sautéed. Very bold flavors with garlic and parmesan shining through. The mushrooms and spinach added some earthiness to it, so it wasn't overpowered by the creamy tastes.

Spicy Chicken & Pork Meatballs w/ Ricotta Ravioli: This dish was good, but not great. What really killed it for me was the temperature. Everything was pretty much lukewarm if even the that. The inside of the ravioli was kind of cold, which threw off the dish for me. The meatballs did have a ton of flavor though...you could taste the herbs that were mixed in.

Grilled Flat Iron Steak w/ Potato-Leek Puree: Great combination of flavors. Initially I thought the steak was under seasoned, but when paired with the potato puree and bacon...it all tied together perfectly. My complaint would be the cooking temperature of the steak. I ordered mines medium rare, which consists of a warm red center. It seems like the grill wasn't hot enough or something? I'm not sure because the center was definitely not a ""warm red"". It was more like a cold translucent red/brown...I'm not even sure how to describe it to be honest. I just know it wasn't cooked how a medium rare steak should be. 

Caramelized Cauliflower with Lemon, Tahini, & Mint: Good, but heavy on the salt and overdressed with Tahini.

My sister ordered the panko crusted chicken breast, which she said was good and consisted of Indian flavors. A tad salty, but still good. My brother ordered the stuffed duck breast, which he enjoyed. He didn't say too much about it. My mom also got the steak. 


Dessert: Chocolate Dulce de Leche Bombe and Sticky Toffee Pudding Cake: Both were really good! Not too heavy on the sweetness - both paired with ice cream which is also a nice touch. It was also nice of them to add on birthday candles! :)

We were not sure if we would need reservations or not, but apparently they had quite a few people planned to come in that night.  However, the entire two hours we were there, there were at least two four tops that were empty the entire time we were there.  That was extremely frustrating.  

Food - The food was very good.  We started with the artisanal salumi platter that came with three selections.  This was excellent and I was surprised to see how much meat was on the plate for the price.  I would have liked to have more bread to put the meat on, but the flavor was great.  We also ordered a cheese platter and we had our server pick the cheeses for us.  She did a great job and we had a beautiful L'Amuse gouda, Stilton and La Tur Italian soft cheese.  

I started with the butter crunch lettuce salad.  I have to admit that the toasted/uncooked quinoa on top was surprising, but it added some nice texture to the dish. The dressing was nicely balanced, but there was some salt on the salad (maybe on the quinoa) that was a bit for my taste.

For my entree, I had the Roasted Organic Chicken Breast goat cheese-wild mushroom stuffing, rapini, on top of creamy polenta.  The chicken breast was cooked wonderfully and they had the bone-in quarter wing for a really nice presentation.  It was juicy and very tender.  Additionally, the polenta with rapini was delicious, but again, it was too salty for my taste.  I believe the chef was a bit heavy handed on the salt on all the dishes. 

The other half had the house Made Ricotta Cavatelli with Lamb & Fennel Ragout.  This was absolutely delicious and the flavor profile was surprisingly fresh.  The lamb was tender and the pasta was a perfect al dente.  The mint was a surprising balance and paired really well with the fennel.  For warm pasta with red meat, this was a surprisingly refreshing dish with the lemon, mint and sweet peas.  

We were so stuffed that we did not have any dessert, but I am sure it is all delicious.  

The service is where this place really falls short.  Our server was super friendly and very knowledgeable, but she was slow to come to our table at first and within just a few minutes, she was in the weeds and trying to work the bar and every table in the bar (about 8 - and they were all full).  It was a little slow to get the plates cleared and with a tiny table, that is frustrating.  

She did choose our cheeses for us and also helped me pair my wine with the food.  She did a great job and was able to tell us a lot about the salumi and cheeses.  The issue was that she didn't bring us our food and by the time she was able to come and tell us about the cheese and salumi we were eating, we had already dug into everything, so the timing was bad.  

Finally, I will go back to the mulitple tables that sat empty the entire time we were there. It is because of this and the slow service that I did not give it five stars.  The food was wonderful and when we did have our server's attention, it was great.  

Would I go back?  Absolutely.  They have a rose of the day which is kind of fun and different.  I would probably go for happy hour instead or make reservations, but dinner at the bar sucks, just because of the lack of space and uncomfortable dining situation.

We went to celebrate a birthday, while we ate so much and didn't order dessert, they didn't bring anything to acknowledge the birthday (even though it was explicitly asked if a candle could be brought so she can make a wish). The check just came at the end of the night. Once we said something to the manager, they said they do not customarily do complimentary desserts but they would make an exception and bring a scoop of ice cream with a candle. It was sort of a let down for the bday celebration. I think the restaurant should reconsider a mini dessert or something to accommodate special occasions; other restaurants definitely have offer a complimentary dessert with ""happy birthday"" written on the plate per se. Our bill was $350 without tip for 4 ppl, so we ate our fair share, and feel it warranted some unsolicited acknowledgement of the special occasion.

1823,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=5oxIvCW2QN_TL3z0ppDrtw,"My husband and I just went here for our anniversary tonight.  Here's our review:

We had reservations and were immediately seated.  The restaurant wasn't busy, but we were seated next to a serving station.  After a few minutes, we asked to be moved away as it was incredibly distracting for the servers to frequently pop over to grab water or place orders here.  Our request was accepted and we slide to the free table next to us.

At first our server seemed impersonal.  She stopped by our table and, without introducing herself or discussing the specials of the night, only asked what we would be having to drink.  We barely had time to review the menu to figure out what we wanted to eat.  However, as the evening progressed, she seemed to warm up.  

We chose the tasting menu without the wine pairings.  We were a little disappointed to see their tasting menu selection was different from that on their website.  Regardless we enjoyed what was there: scallops, beef checks, and lamb as the three entrees for the evening.  The scallops were excellent, but the overall place had too much acidity from the orange slices.  The beef checks were good, but the pasta was incredibly hot.  The lamb was a smudge overdone (very little pink), but still melted in my mouth.  For desert, I chose to have the chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream.  My husband had the cheese plate.  Both options were good.  We did have a few glasses of wine.  The waitress was very knowledgeable about the wines and led us in the right direction.  

The atmosphere of the restaurant is interesting.  Bottles of wine cover most of the restaurant walls.  It gives a sense of intimacy that reminds me of some of the smaller restaurants in the Sonoma Valley in CA.  However, the restrooms were out of place with this decor.  Stainless steal walls and toilets made it feel like I was either at the  Silver Diner or in an Amtrak train.  Because the bathroom stall door did not have a handle to help close it, I had to use my shoe to close the door of the stall.

Lastly, we had noted with our reservation that it was our anniversary, yet we did not receive any ""special"" treatment (champagne or otherwise) as other reviewers had noted with their experiences.

What I liked - 
1. location (both for the restaurant and our table in the restaurant - we called ahead to ask for a window.  It was a Caps game night and watching the flow of red & white clad fans added to the fun)
2. service - our server was attentive and seemed to know his wine which is good for a place that features wine.  He also did a good job explaining the menu and the sourcing of the food
3. scallion hushpuppy - yum!
4. olives - decent size and very tasty
5. menu - lots of options (though the entrees did not intrigue me on our visit)
6. decor & layout - intimate and open space (a hard balance to maintain).  Our out-of-town guest really liked the space.


What I didn't - 
1. butternut squash soup - $12? not so much.  However, I'd pay $12 for a shallow bowl of soup if it was amazing, or maybe even good.  It was just meh.  Maybe too late in the season?
2. service - he forget an order (olives) and it came late in the meal after we asked about our late and briny friends.
3. lavash & cucumber dip - cardboard and glue.  really
4. duck confit - not quite there
5. escarole salad - out of the three salads we had it was a dud (mozzarella & buttercrunch were very good)
6. gross couple across from us - him, physically 66 pushing mentally 14, her, loaded down with tucks, nips, and augmentations, not to mention failed dreams and dashed expectations.  watching most people play tonsil hockey, even on a game night, is foul.  for these two, just about ruined the meal

Also, while we are big wine fanatics, I find their wine list to be out of range for the food they serve; their wine list would work well at Marcel's, but it focuses on really high end offerings with prices to match -- and not enough in the lower and middle ranges to choose from.  Nothing we had would pair well enough with a $800+ bottle of wine (of which there are many to choose from), but why not offer lots of choices in the $75 - $120 range that align better with the menu?

I will say that I know the CA wine scene very well, as I am there often and have personally been to many vineyards and wineries in CA, from Sonoma, Napa, Santa Barbara, to Carmel Valley/my beloved Monterey.  I loved that they had wine from Gary Pisoni - the Pisoni family is well known in CA - especially in Monterey for their Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Gary is a rock star on the wine scene and well known and loved by many people.  It is special to me I can actually find wine from Gary Pisoni in DC, especially during bouts when I haven't been to Monterey or Big Sur for a little while.

The food was also very good - cooked perfectly.  If you order all 3 courses, you are left feeling satisfied, but not overly full, so the portion size is appropriate.  Of course, the wine is the best thing here.  :)

So, while the wine and food were very good.  I must say that the service was not good.  My group spent a few hundred dollars on dinner, which I don't normally do.  I realized our parking meter right by the restaurant ran out and I needed quarters so my friend wouldn't get a ticket.  I got out some money and asked the waitress if she wouldn't mind getting some change before we left.  She gave me a funny look and said that she perhaps could, but ""it would be a while"" before she could bring change and told me to go to the bar and get it myself.  You would think being an otherwise polite guest and having spent some of my well earned money here would have afforded a ""sure, no problem"" attitude.  This wasn't the case and it left a poor impression on the whole experience, unfortunately.

A restaurant with a fine wine list and fantastic chef should also have 5 star service, especially for the prices they are charging.  They need to improve in this area for it to deserve a higher rating from me - a good restaurant needs to have all aspects perfect for a 5 star rating on the whole experience, especially if they have the audacity to up-charge for wine as much as I know they do.

The best thing about Proof is probably its location: right across the street from the Chinatown metro/Verizon Center and the National Portrait Gallery. 

Inside, the decor is very upscale contemporary, and additional kudos for the pink Marilyn Monroe-inspired bathroom. 

The wine list is pretty massive and includes a ""Table of Contents"" to guide you through the 50+ pages of wines from all over the world. Those are all by the bottle, however, and very pricey. The ""by the glass"" menu is only a page long and one has a choice of either a 2oz taster, a 6oz regular, or an 8oz, um, chug?? Anyway, prices range from $9 to about $12 for the standard 6oz. 

As for the menu itself, there is an extensive list of cheese and ""charcuterie"" (meat) items. My friend got the Prosciutto San Daniele ($13), which came accompanied by a side of amazingly delicious toasted bread. Also, each table gets a small basket of crisps and a sour cream-y/dill spread... a very good start to any meal. 
For a main meal, I ordered the only vegetarian item on the ""Seconds"" part of the menu: the Tofu ""Napoleon"" with roasted vegetables and chili sauce ($23). It sort of tasted like an ordinary Chinese takeout meal, a little on the oily side. Also, I was unaware that the tofu would be fried, although it did add a pleasant crunch to the dish. My friend got the Honey & Spice glazed Peking Duck Breast ($27). He mentioned several times how the duck ""melted"" in his mouth, and that the dish was ""gorgeous"" (he's British)... So I'm guessing he might've liked his choice slightly more than I liked mine. 

I do have to add that the food did take a very long time to arrive, and that we only got the basket of crisps after I asked for them. Granted it was a Friday night, but it didn't seem to me like they were that busy, especially since they had about five additional people running around the patio area refilling waters and picking up dishes. 

Although it was great experience to dine here on a beautiful summer-nearly-fall night, I do have to add that when it comes down to it, there are simply too many better options in the DC Chinatown area (Oyamel, Matchbox, La Tasca) for Proof to deserve more than 3 stars.

There are approx 20 whites and 20 reds to choose from - they don't offer tastings or flights (at least that we could see).  What they do offer is glasses of either 2, 6 or 8.5 ounces, which is not a bad idea, but prices seemed high for wines that were just average.  An average 2 ounce glass is $5, $15 for a 6 oz glass or $20 for a 8 .5 oz glass.  For $20 a glass the wine better be exceptional, and it wasn't, and even then, if I have to spend $20 a glass it would be nice to taste it first, as opposed to spending $5 for a 2 ounce taste.  So while I like the 2/6/8.5 ounce options, I don't like them at these prices.

We stopped in for an early dinner before the Hershey Bears game at Verizon Center.  You definitely can't beat the convenience. We were both exhausted, so we skipped wine -- the wine list looked great and about average on pricing, but we didn't order any drinks.

To start, we shared an order of serrano ham from the charcuterie menu.  It was delicious -- served with tasted baguette slices.  I then had the butter lettuce salad (with citrus and avocado) and tuna tartar, and my husband had the soup (white beans with other flavors) and a side of brussel sprouts.

2108,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=nMFlEQRj3MAeo9pcjbGCKw,"3.5 stars.  I could probably be swayed to 4 stars by a second visit.

The first part of my birthday dining tour was dinner at Proof (second part was brunch at Matchbox on 8th), and it was really a nice way to ring in 25.  While dinner started off with a slight hitch when I had to ask for a different table after we were seated right next to the service station (where water jugs, silverware, etc. are kept - very high-traffic, not good for a special occasion...I just hope the family with kids one table over didn't think we asked to move because of them!), our server was pretty good and the rest of the meal went off without a hitch.

We started with a cheese plate (3 for $16) accompanied by a 2-oz. pour of chablis recommended by our waiter, and I finally got to try the Mt. Tam everyone raves so much about.  I was really impressed by their cheese bar, and the accompaniments on the board were interesting - raw honey, vanilla applesauce, a smoked apricot, and raisin-pecan toast slices.  Given the overall sweetness of the selection (which I wasn't expecting), I can see ordering cheese for dessert at Proof, rather than to start.  We did not order any charcuterie, but the couple next to us did and it appeared to be very generous portions.  I was surprised at the relatively short list of wines by the glass.  I like the 2/4/6-oz. pour options, but given that they have an entire volume (seriously, it's a heavy binder's worth) of wines by the bottle, I thought there would be more choices to try.

Next up were first courses of shrimp-stuffed squash blossoms on a bed of heirloom cherry tomatoes (the blossoms were delicately fried and the tomatoes were perfect - a really nice combination) and ahi tuna tartare.  The blood-red tuna was obviously very high-quality, but I felt like the dish needed something - some sea salt, perhaps, or some other flavor component.

Second courses were the hangar steak, served on roasted red peppers and orzo-like pasta (""semolina pearls"", now that I refer back to the menu), and the spice-glazed duck breast with yam puree.  The second courses were fine, but I found the duck breast in particular to be a bit of a let-down after all the previous high reviews.  There was no interplay between the components - they were all very sweet - and the topping of grilled scallions was surprisingly inedible.  I might have been more amenable to this dish in the fall or winter, when the spice glaze wouldn't have seemed as out of place.  In sum - underwhelming, especially given the prices per plate ($27 each, I believe).

To accompany our first and second courses, we went with a bottle of pinot noir from an Oregon vintner.  When ordering, my date mentioned having a good track record with pinots from the Willamette Valley, to which our server replied that the bottle in question was not from the valley but actually from some mountain.  We were a bit taken aback at the correction, but shrugged it off as we don't claim to be wine snobs.  When our server returned with the bottle later, he backpedaled furiously, telling us that he was mistaken and that the aforementioned mountain was, in fact, considered part of the Willamette Valley.  We appreciated his honesty and attention to detail, but he probably could have just kept mum on the initial correction, y'know?  It didn't change our enjoyment of the bottle at all.

We shared a dessert of berry shortcake.  I liked the use of strawberry sorbet rather than ice cream, but the layer of creme fraiche wasn't enough to salvage the somewhat dry biscuit.  The whole dessert was strongly herby (definitely mint, and maybe something else).  Next time, I'd probably do the cheese course for dessert instead, as none of the desserts sounded/looked particularly earth-shattering.

I'd return to Proof for with a group for wine, cheese, and ""firsts"" - but probably not expect a full meal.  The space is lovely (smaller than I anticipated, but intimate while still comfortable), the service is attentive and helpful, and the ingredients are obviously high-quality.  With a few tweaks, or perhaps a different ordering strategy, I think Proof could easily earn a 4-star or higher review from me.

The menu left me befuddled. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but the chef's tasting menu was a list of discrepant selections leaving me incurious--something I rarely am, especially while dining. I loved the inventiveness, but some of the dishes, aside from being inharmonious course-to-course, seemed to have trouble walking the line between culinary creativity and straight-up food flops.

The service was wonderful. While my server did suggest a Riesling that was nothing more than an apple juice dopplegänger, she happily sent it back and replaced it with something more to my taste. For the first time in my life, it took me longer to figure out what to order than it did for the food to come out. I was astounded with how seamless and rapid the food service was.

Fully running with the confusion theme, my date and I ordered the octopus salad, mushroom and Gruyere tart and tasty little meatballs to sample during the first course (they were out of the Persian cucumber salad, my original selection). The octopus was done to perfection, but the vinaigrette was sickly sweet and single-handedly ruined the dish. The braised little meatballs were amazing. The whole dish--including the luscious little ravioli sidekicks--was delectable. Sharp flavors (goat cheese in the pasta) that harmonized well, cooked perfectly and lots of palatable texture going on. The tart was nicely done; the pastry was made with crazy skills and dusted with a smidgen of sugar to boot, which set the crispy mushrooms and shallots off like fireworks. The arugula was sparse and a bit dry--I'd like to see this dish with another green on top. 

For the main course, I chose the pork loin: huge mistake. Think little discs of rubber, in both flavor and texture. The grilled radicchio was bitter beyond belief. The beans and tomatoes were a nice touch, and the vinaigrette in this dish was tasty. On the flipside, my date ordered the hanger steak, accompanied by tomato and bread salad. I had serious second-course envy after trying one bite. The steak was seared, tender, seasoned--every detail was perfect. The chimichurri vinaigrette was a smart touch.

Proof is set up to keep you coming back. The menu is varied enough and one can tailor it to fit any appetite at any hour. The problem is, I'm not dying to do so. I always like to give things a few tries, though, so I'll get around to it after I visit the other D.C. spots I haven't been to yet.

My first experience at this place was at lunch time.  I had an excellent lamb burger with a very unique chick pea french frie kind of side dish.  It was creative, tasty, and my husband and I were thrilled.  The salt they use is a course, sea salt thing and it is excellent.  Their chef could win Top Chef.

When I tried to return weeks later for a repeat, I was literally turned away because they were too busy.  Every other restaurant would tell you how long of a wait it would be and leave it up to you on whether you wanted to stay or not.  But no - these people were shockingly rude - they just turned me away.  At that time, I was a DC resident and frequent restaurant goer, and I promise you, that kind of response is rare and unprofessional.  I almost told them so, but I was hungry and hopped to the next restaurant.

Now I live in MD but still have a craving for a repeat experience of my first dish there.  I went out of my way to get there this evening and at 5:30pm, they told me that they were not open yet or serving meals (!!!!!)  Because I had traveled, I bit my tongue and allowed them to usher me to to the bar.  They told me it would just be a few minutes.  I sat there for 15 minutes, then all of these people started coming in to be seated, and I was pissed.  I walked up to the front desk and asked what time I could be seated because I didn't have the luxury of waiting for 30 minutes.  I am shy and it takes a lot to push me to speak up, but this was insane.  It's not like the hostesses were busy...they were fully staffed and lazy.

No apology - they just said ""oh!"" like they had forgotten about me - and seated me.

Then, the menu did not have the same dishes as the lunch menu.  When I asked the waitress, she was like ""no, we don't serve the lunch dishes right now.""  She didn't ask the chef, didn't ask the manager - no effort on her part at all.  This is not how the top class restaurants function.  When I go to Bistro Bis, the French Restaurant on E Street that is THE place to be - they recognize me as a regular, treat me like royalty, and the ONE time I asked about something that had disappeared from the menu - they made it for me.  It's highly unlikely that they don't have the ingredients or know-how in the back.

So, since they had wasted all of my time, I just ordered a quick duck entree.  It took a while, but it was so delicious.  The food here is excellent - you just have to swim through a thick wall of attitude and BS to get it.  It was the best duck I have had - just watch though - tomorrow it will disappear from the menu.  And I was so angry over the service that I was not able to fully enjoy it.

Next to me, I heard two ladies who were unhappy because they could not be seated in a booth.  They are reserved for 3-4 parties.  This is the problem with the place - they don't care about their customers.  These women WANTED a booth, and when I left, there were empty booths.  Why not give the customers what they want so they spread good things about you??  It's a small town - work the word of mouth system.  What is up with these people...""No, we can't do this, no, we can't do that.""  I go out to eat for a good time.

Oh, I also missed my train home by 5 minutes due to the slow service, etc.

So, the food is over the top excellent - unbelievable - but the service is really horrifying to me since they are trying to tap into the exclusive, upper crust, well-educated market.  People who dine at the top places know what to look for and their service is just pathetic.  I may write the restaurant a letter to complain.

But, the duck was sublime, so I don't know what to tell you.  I mean, now I have a craving for it.  The food is addictive if you get one of the things they prepare really well.  I think it's the salt they use.  Maybe go in really late when they are sure to be open but not so crowded that they turn you away.  Research the menu online first because I forgot to mention that they did not have specials, and go in prepared so you don't have to communicate much with the waiter (in case they are jerky).

Kind of silly, I know.  I wish their chef would open up a friendlier restaurant.

Every decent restaurant has a simple system to designate who gets what yet this happens all the time and at much more elegant restaurants than Proof. I will return as the pluses outweigh the minuses.

Atmosphere: We were seated by the window, so I didn't find it as dark as you probably would if you're in a booth on the other side of the room. I didn't need the goofy little flashlight/magnifying glass they provided to read the menu with, but I appreciate the gesture. I thought it was a little tacky that our server told us as she was handing them out that we had to return them (having someone assume I have sticky fingers isn't exactly welcoming), but I suppose they must've had people pocket them in the past. Proof's interior is cozy, with wine racks covering the far wall. Bar area is pretty tiny. 

Food: Very tasty. Nothing super interesting, but that's not always what I'm looking for in a meal. The mushroom quiche appetizer is to die for. You MUST order it. The squash/chestnut soup was good, but I felt the flavor of the soup was overpowered by the foie gras shaved on top of it. I had the scallops for my entree. The were very good but the real star of the plate was the mushroom bread pudding. It was so good--but so little! I would have traded back at least two of my scallops for more of that pudding. I had a bit of my friend's goat cheese/mushroom stuffed chicken--that was delicious. I kind of wish I'd ordered that instead. My dessert was killer: the sticky toffee pudding cake. Sweet, moist, wonderful. My friend was disappointed in her chocolate spice cake--I think she wanted it to be more chocolatey. Another friend was likewise underwhelmed by the chocolate bread pudding. It was fine but not really worth the calorie splurge. Just get the sticky toffee pudding cake.

Service: Service was good. 
PLUS: they let us wait at our table for a member of our group who was running late. That's exactly the kind of thing I appreciate when I've gone to the trouble of making a reservation. 
MINUS: We were celebrating a birthday. Of course, the kitchen sent out the birthday girl's dessert with a candle. Unfortunately, the desserts were delivered when two people from our four-person party were in the restroom. Really, you couldn't have until everyone was seated? Not a huge deal, but it makes me consider Proof's service good rather than great.

Lots of great wine to choose from BTG. As far as the bottle selection, tons of great, rare, and expensive wines, but to the average drinker or budding wine enthusiast, its cumbersome, confusing, and hard to use. They would have been better served creating two lists an everyday list and a reserve list, for those adventurers into the depths of their pockets.

About the food, the Wagyu Beef Sashimi is a definite miss. While the presentation looked great, the entire thing was drowning in soy sauce. I've eaten plenty of Wagyu and Kobe to know that it has a very uniquely delicious flavor, this could have been deli cold cuts and you wouldn't have known the difference because of the soy. The small Asian salad that accompanied it was nice and crunchy, but was otherwise uninteresting. For a second, I had another appetizer (was dining at the bar on sleepy Sunday evening, about the only time the place isn't packed) the Meatballs with a Tomato Fondue.

As I looked around the restaurant for the first time, I noticed a very trendy atmosphere.  The seats were all in dark brown leather and the bar was in decorated in stainless steel.  Obviously, the bar is the hot spot of this restaurant it was packed on a Tuesday night--all the DC yuppies twirling their wine and watching the legs run down the side of the glass pretending they know something about wine.  There is house Sommelier onsite, who I think comes from Komi.  He kept the guest entertained while he wowed them with his knowledge and suggestions of wine.  For many guest he is a great tool and I highly recommend consulting with him, as the wine menu is very extensive and can be overwhelming.

For the first course, we ordered the Yukon Gold gnocchi with Lima beans, mushrooms and corn.  I was not impressed!  The Lima beans were under cooked and the gnocchi it self was average.  I must say the most disappointing part of the appetizer was the price-- $21.00 for a very small portion, and we ordered the large!

Now our palettes have been teased as we wait anxiously for our main course to be brought out to us.  I ordered the hanger steak medium and my only compliant was that it came out rare--I noticed that undercooked food seemed to be the theme of the night.  Other than that it was good. A nice cut of beef and the side of spinach with bacon was very complementary.  My husband ordered the salmon with caramelized cauliflower--it was excellent!  Not one complaint with his dish and I must say the caramelized cauliflower was the highlight of the night.

As our waited cleared our plates and the night got later and the lights were being turned down to create a romantic mood for the late evening winos we sat at our booth and tasted the many wines Proof has to offer.  The great thing about their wine menu is that you can order a glass in three different sizes:  2oz (tasting), 6oz (glass), 8.5 (about 2 glasses).  The wine was very reasonably priced and our waiter was very knowledgeable of all the grapes and their heritage.  Proof offers unusual grapes from Italy, Spain and Portugal and many other regions.

My boy and I went here for a celebratory dinner last night - although the weather was perfect outside, we opted to sit inside where it was much quieter and great music could be heard if you tuned your ears into the sounds. Although we were literally the first diners in the restaurant (no reservation made, but also not needed at 5:30pm), and clearly the patio was going to fill, our hostess had some trouble seating us in any of the desired locations and initially gave us possibly the worst table in the house. The meal starts with bread crisps (need a little bit of salt) and some kind of cream-and-EVOO-based dipping sauce - bland. We ordered a cheese plate and wine - the cheese selections are just OK and they give you fairly tiny portions to work with. However, the accompanying raw honey, applesauce and fig were just the right sized portions. One shouldn't have leftovers of the accompaniments to a cheese plate (and neither my boy nor I are stingy with our add-ons).
Dinner itself fell a little flat. He went for the hanger steak, and for me, the duck. Nothing to rave about for the prices we paid. While the food wasn't bad, I felt it to be quite standard and lacking in zest and personal touch from the chef. Nothing innovative here.
Would I go again? Probably not unless someone else suggested it, or maybe I would be willing to try the lunch specials. Would I suggest a friend to go here? Probably only if they're standing right in front of it or can't get a table in Zaytina, Jaleo, Poste, or Matchbox, all within a few blocks radius.

I was mildly disappointed by Proof. Maybe it was what I ordered; the folks who were dining with me (mother, sister and grandma... celebrating my graduation from high school) seemed satisfied. The atmosphere of the restaurant itself is great: spacious, beautiful architecture and plenty of wine bottles. I can't drink (or rather, the state doesn't let me) but I can imagine that a fan of wine would love it here what with all the variety. Service was very friendly and quick, as well as accommodating (they heated up milk for us so we could make cafe au lait since their espresso machine was broken, meaning no lattes). 

So why the low rating? Well, I ordered the Alaskan Halibut. The waiter said that it was an entree-sized portion. Now I'm not gonna lie, I'm a hungry guy. I can/have to eat a lot. So this is where the restaurant lost a lot of its points. I got a pretty small portion of halibut, although it was grilled quite well and was in a small spicy broth with vegetables and pearl pasta. It tasted good, but it wasn't memorable. I think part of that lies with the fish itself, as well as the fact that it was simply pan-seared and not fried or crusted or anything like that. But for $24 I expected far more. This is a very notable problem with all 'upscale' and 'fancy' restaurants: they sometimes require you to dress in a certain manner, charge very high prices, and then give you less food than you'd get at, say, Clyde's. In fact, I could have gotten far more food (that would still be very delicious) at Clyde's for much cheaper.

My sister and mother both got the gnocchi with ramps and spinach, and said it was good. My grandmother got the quiche and enjoyed it. But again, these portions were way too small.

Dessert was great though. I had the Honey Goat Cheesecake, which is something like honey, creme fraiche with goat cheese (but it's not strong goat cheese), and raspberries and some sort of cookie crumble. Very creamy and delicious. The coffee was also good.

What we have here is a restaurant trying to be something like the restaurant in the Mandarin Hotel, with pricing to boot, but in reality the food and surroundings are no more special than any other restaurant in town.  Think of Proof, not as a restaurant, but a wine bar instead.  They have great wines, albeit over priced by about 700 percent.  Breaks my heart to remember the prices of these bottles when I lived in Europe and to see wines available at a local convenience store there, selling for $450 here.  What a ripoff.  We stopped by Proof one night to look inside before making a reservation.  It was so ridiculously dark in there that we decided to make reservations about 6 PM while the sun remained up.

We came here on Friday night for dinner.  My dining partner had an odd, ginger-y vodka drink and an outstanding glass of red wine.  Proof has a fantastic wine selection, it's probably worth adventuring through it.

The food was hit and miss though.  We started with a cheese plate, which had nice sides including an interesting sort of vanilla applesauce.  The pork confit appetizer was the one outstanding moment, glazed and cooked perfectly, even if the jicama salad was too cute by half.  As for the carpaccio, Proof falls into the same trap as the other times I've tried this dish in DC -- drowning the poor cow.  There's so much stuff covering it, hoisin sauce, lots of basil, drippy pickled onions, you lose the flavor of the meat itself. (Though this wasn't nearly as bad as the mustard overload at Sonoma -- it's raw beef, not a damn hot dog).  Finally, we split the hangar steak entree, which was a little undercooked (medium-rare does not mean raw,) with largely decorative tomatoes and a vinegar-heavy salad. 

Overall, the food was mediocre apart from the top-notch pork confit.  The ambiance was nice though, service was quick and pleasant, and it has a cool vibe and outstanding wine selection.  Proof is recommended for a few drinks with a group or a date, though the food simply wasn't good enough across the board for the prices.  If you live or work in the neighborhood, check out the impressive $12 lunch special -- if the pulled pork sandwich is as good as the confit appetizer was, it'll make a great mid-day combo with a glass of wine.

Complaint: our server was a bit of a tool. Best case scenario, he's just lacking in the technical skills required to provide excellent service. Worst case, he makes assumptions about which tables are worthy of his attention, and which he must attend to at a bare minimum. If the latter is the case, we clearly didn't meet his muster. 
As an example, he chatted with a table next to us for a full five minutes, before even taking our drink order. Odd as they had already enjoyed their meal and were getting ready to leave. He asked them where they were from, gave some tourist tips, including pointing out that D.C. is an expensive city, and adding that this is his second job, he only needs it to pay for his $4,000 house. Umm, ok. 
Next example, my husband asked about the $13 cider on the menu. His question was simply whether it was for a single glass or perhaps a larger bottle. The response was a seemingly sassy, ""We're not cheap here."" Ummm, ok. I'm still left wondering what he may have been implying. Did we seem cheap to him.? That might explain why he only stopped back to check on us and get a second round once, despite the fact that it was early in the evening and there were only a few other tables. Or maybe it was, like I said before, that he's just not the best server. Fair enough, but if you are going to point out that you aren't a cheap place, then you better have service to match the prices. 
As a side note, the food is moderately priced, so I'm not sure what that was all about. And again, the food was delicious.

The ones on the bottom had a lot of chocolate on them and the ones on top had none. The chocolate was also supposed to have an orange flavor to it, which I didn't taste at all. For our entrees, we got the florentine omelet and the steak and eggs. The florentine omelet was nice and light, and it came with local potato home fries, which were pretty good. The steak and eggs dish was fine, but the steak (local sirloin) wasn't particularly flavorful. The eggs were cooked perfectly, but weren't seasoned at all. I didn't see any waiters anywhere, and I didn't want to wait for my food to get cold, so I got up myself and grabbed some salt and pepper from the bar. The dish also came with what was described on the menu to be goat cheese polenta, but I didn't really get the nice tangy bite that goat cheese usually delivers. I wondered why, until I heard the waitress describe the dish to another table, and say that the polenta was actually made with gorgonzola. No wonder it didn't taste like I expected it to. 

So, the service was very friendly, but not particularly attentive, and two of the dishes weren't served totally as described. But the food tasted good - not amazing, but good - and I think the prices are about right.

This isn't a fancy place, per say, but I felt very out of place in my middle-school-teacher-khakis-cardigan-and-flats attire. Also, my friend and I were probably the only people in there NOT talking politics. Anyway, I digress.

Sonoma has a lot going for it. It is super popular not just for wines but for dinner as well. Beautiful exposed brick walls add to the charm. If its super crowded, it gets very loud, but it can also be a nice spot for a quiet date. 

After a few of one of their specialty cocktails - la dolce vita, a grapefruity concoction complete with little grapefruit shavings on top - I thought it was just good. Very tangy and not as sweet as I had thought it would be, but good nonetheless. For dinner, the regular marinara pizza hit the spot in terms of taste, but certainly not for texture (soggy bottom!). Sonoma ain't cheap, so I was expecting something a little higher in quality.

Service was decent - nobody bothered us to hurry up when we were clearly done and just chatting - but I was confused by how we seemed to have 3 different waitresses that night.

The restaurant area was not crowded (and is on a separate floor from their happy hour lounge). It was pretty empty when we arrived, and still had plenty of tables when we left at 7:45.

The entrees didn't really appeal to us, so we ordered the cheese board, charcuterie board, and several small plates: burrata, market crudo, and calamari fritz. We also ordered two wine flights, which we both sampled.

All of the food was excellent. The boards are much more generous than we were expecting--we probably got two ounces of each cheese, the sliced meats were easily a handful, and the (house-made) pates were similarly generous. The accompanying fruit spreads and pickled vegetables were a nice counterpoint to the meats and cheeses. Our favorites were the chicken liver pate and bella vitano espresso sharp cheese. We will definitely order these again when we go back.

Of the small plates, the calamari was excellent. I've only had better in a small Italian restaurant that's out of state. The burrata and crudo were fine; they're nice to get because you can't easily purchase them in a store, but weren't outstanding.

The wines were... disappointing. You would think, that after ordering essentially six wines, we would have found something that was tasty and complimented the meal. Unfortunately, I think that Sonoma fails here by being too pretentious. There are a lot of really good wines out there, but they haven't fleshed out their wine list. They also don't describe the wines beyond varietal, winery, and production year. I would really appreciate a more thorough list, with some less-expensive options, highlighting the different regions of California and maybe some local Virginia and Maryland wineries.

Our servers were outstanding, and the ambience was perfect for our anniversary dinner. We'll definitely go back, but we'll be a little more discretionary with our wine choices next time.

The atmosphere and look of the place are terrific, and the staff are friendly and highly competent. The wine selection is great and some of the menu items (meatballs, soups, pasta) are delicious.

The roast potatoes, for example, are too-large chunks of potato with apparently no seasoning at all. The roasted fennel is also just that; it could use some sea salt or anything to make the flavors deeper and more interesting. The polenta is fantastic but the mushrooms are only so-so. 

Note that I haven't reviewed any of the entrees. They're pricey, but maybe they are worth it. My view is that everything on the menu should be equally excellent, and if the basics are not, I'm less willing to ""pay up"" for entrees that are more complex and difficult to execute.

We decided to go with glasses of wine, not a bottle, and started with 2 cheeses.  The waiter quickly came to tell us about the specials, but it was at least another 15 minutes before he took our order.  The deduction of the stars is due to the slightly below average service.  

Following the cheese we ordered a salad special which was heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella cheese, which was fantastic.  For the main courses, i ordered the burger and my gf ordered a pizza.  I was quite happy that they actually cooked the burger rare, as many places wont do it.  

The waiter never came back to our table a single time between the food arriving and asking if we wanted dessert.  We didn't have a chance to order another glass of wine.  The food here is always superb and the wine selection is as well.  Overall, I enjoy it as one of the better wine bars, but there service definitely needs to step it up.

We didn't make a reservation because they were full, but my husband and I decided to try it out since I bought a groupon the day before.  We started with a beer for the hubs and me with a taste of a glass of Pinot Grigio.  The pinot was ok, but it was only $4 so no big deal, plus the bar tender was pouring generously.  

At this point, we had waited quite a bit to get our drink order in so we decided to order our whole meal just in case we didn't get his attention again.  It was a really busy night and the bar tender was the only one behind the bar servicing about 15 people!  Our first course came, we ordered a cheese sampler.  This was ok, the pieces of cheese were small and the accompaniments (fruit chutney, etc) were beyond small, you could eat the whole serving in one bite, not enough to go around really.  

My husband ordered the margarita pizza, which was just ok, and I got the ricotta gnocchi - which while the flavor was great, only got like 12 pieces of small SMALL gnocchi.  Really the portions here are skimpy and you end up paying a grip. 

The 2.75 stars really goes to the bar tender who kept everyone serviced and happy.  The atmosphere is great - I should mention that the decor is impeccable and very clean and neat.  I also like the idea that they use sustainable products whenever they can.

I liked the decor. There is a casual elegance to it and a great place for a date. I don't know that I would really use it for a special occasion though, because the setting is not that intimate (downstairs). It's just alright.

Would definitely recommend the meatball and pollenta appetizer (it's more of a small entree), the steak (very well seasoned), and the lamb (better than the steak, but obviously much lighter). I think we paired with a red blend that sounded like Longshoreman, but one too many glasses to recall.

Hard to gauge the price because it was Restaurant Week, but the service was excellent. I do wish Sonoma played up the wine aspect of things a little more. The staff was knowledgeable, but at times I felt like it was just a pretty good restaurant, and not really a wine bar.

Some of the food we had was executed well, some of it not so well. We started with the chicken liver mousse, which I think is made in-house. The mousse was fantastic. A nice creamy consistency, yet I would've preferred it a few degrees warmer. I think that's just me, though. 

We followed it with the grilled sardines. Our server told us not many people order them, but I don't know why (Yes, I do actually, but I'll resist my temptation to slam the American palate any more than I just did.). The sardines were absolutely amazing and fresh tasting, considering it was probably last week's order.

The fennel salad was next, and it was kind of disappointing. I love fennel to death, but this salad needed more fruit on it to balance out all the flavors. And where was the creme fraiche? Definitely could have used more. 

An order of parpadelle with veal ragu was next. (Yes, we ate a lot of food.) The veal ragu was amazing, small cubes in a nice demi came out real well. The pasta itself could've benefited from another 60 seconds in the water. 

Finally, our main course arrived. We went with the sea bream, a mild white fish from the Mediterranean, and the lamb, cooked rare. The fish was incredibly salty, but my date refused to send it back. Sea bream is not a super salty fish, so I don't understand why it was so salty. The lamb, while not as salty as the fish, probably had a pinch or two more than necessary. It was cooked well, though, definitely worth getting again. I also appreciated the fact that they know what 'rare' means. Some chefs in this town seem timid when it comes to serving meat cooked truly rare.

I had the pasta shrimp with the brandy sauce and my girlfriend had the mushroom burger with the roasted potatoes.

2638,Sonoma Restaurant & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=Eo4iEYfKEyKVoNOzJdY2Rw,"Summary: A mediocre execution that left a disheartening aftertaste

Indulging in Sonoma's menu had long been something on our ""to-do"" list. First introduced to the restaurant as an event venue, we had been back for drinks and light conversation. We loved the atmosphere, the knowledgable staff, and the fantastic wine list. In a Californian interior mixed with a cozy brick decor, the only thing more comforting was the knowledge and attitude of the staff, eager to find you your new favorite wine. On past visits, we had even sampled parts of their small plates and pizza menu section and started to gain an appreciation for kitchen's technique. Eager to dine on the rest of Sonoma's cuisine, we made our long await reservation and arrived expecting a fantastic meal. As always, the staff was courteous and expertly divined a bottle of wine to suit our mood. Although our meal had started off to justify our past experiences, it was not long into the night when our elation deflated. As it has with past restaurants we have reviewed (Graffiato), our dishes at Sonoma left us unsure and disappointed.

Our first order were the house-made meatballs, savory spheres of meats in a dish filled with sugo finto, anason mills polenta, ricotta, and topped with pine nuts. The meatballs were incredibly tender and exhibited a surprisingly smoky character, flavor that was nicely soaked up by the fresh ragu. The woody taste of the pine nuts brought an added spin on the meatballs, pairing nicely to summon an almost mesquite flavor. The ricotta brought the dish fully together and deep impression in our minds: a simple order executed flawlessly.

The next thing on our table was a bowl of Sweet Potato Curry Soup, pureed sweet potatoes and peppers with curry spices. A spoonful of the liquid brought little else to mind beyond the flavor of curry, little substance or body to define it. A thin consistency and barely a hint of taste from the sweet potato base, this dish was little more than a bowl of yellow curry.

For our first entree, we decided on the Roasted Mennonite Chicken, served sitting on bed of sliced carrots, turnips, and a mixture of roasted farro and some salt pork. The skin of the chicken was crisp, but the poultry itself was slightly overcooked. Conversely, both the turnips and carrots were under cooked, only slightly softened on the surface and raw in the middle. While the roasted farro mixed with cubed salt pork beautifully soaked up the buttery stock from the chicken, its texture was unduly rough and would have been better served a slight bit softer. Although all the flavors and character of the ingredients were there, this dish suffered from a mishandled execution.

Our final dish of the night was the house-made Fettuccine, served under red wine braised beef, rosemary, and shredded grana padano cheese. Cooked al dente, the home-made pasta was sublime as only fresh pasta can be and worked wonders in soaking up the flavor from the beef, the meat shredded and succulent. However, the overwhelming taste of dish was not the red wine beef or even the beautifully prepared pasta, but the haunting presence of rosemary. No matter how you loaded your fork, it still loomed heavy on the senses like an unrelenting specter. The grana padano cheese did help cut some of the herb's dominance, but a healthy addition of beef stock (or just a lot less rosemary) would have made this dish more manageable.

Despite the charming atmosphere, impressive staff, and seductive menu, many of the dishes fell flat. We had been to Sonoma before for events and drinks, but never dinner itself. What made this experience so lukewarm was that we knew Sonoma to be better than much of what we were given. Nonetheless, our opinions were chained to only what we were plated during that service. It would be a lie to say we won't indulge in the restaurant again, but it may be a while before we suggest Sonoma as a dinner destination to anyone outside of the Capitol Hill area. For now, we will stick to the small plates, the pizza and the wine.

I came here once for a firm event over the summer and for a second time last night.  I was underwhelmed by the group dinner.  I remember the soup being cold and the beef entree having too much fat marbled into it.   Our dinner was preceded by a wine tasting, which was a nice touch.

Last night, however, I had the scallops on arugula and shaved fennel.  It was a bit heavy on the sauce, but overall it was a really nice, satisfying dish.  There were 6 good sized scallops, perfectly cooked and the arugula was fresh and added a nice bite.  I didn't have any wine, but just stuck with Yuengling.  My friend had the burger and it looked good, though I didn't try it.

Service:  I showed up at Sonoma mid-week at 7:30.   Upon entering we were told that because we didn't have a reservation no tables would be available for at least one hour.  I didn't see anyone else waiting, so I asked if it was possible for something to open up sooner, to which the hostess responded that it ""could happen.""  We headed to the bar instead.  We were immediately informed that the bar was accepting only cash.  No biggie, it happens.  We stayed.  The bartender readily handed over a wine list, but that (and the check) were the only times they were responsive or attentive.  We had to flag someone down to order drinks, then food, and no one ever checked on us after our drinks or food arrived.  I would have ordered another glass of wine but the opportunity didn't present itself.  Also, by 8pm there were many open tables, leading me to believe the hostess really didn't know what she was talking about.  Generally, everyone who worked there had major attitude.  The place was not crowded, so I don't get it.  

Food/Wine: I had a good glass of wine, my date had a beer.  The food, however, was the highlight.  We split grilled calamari with red beans, papardelle with pork Bolognese, and chard with chili.  Everything we ate was excellent, well seasoned and balanced.  

Would I go back? Nope.  The food was great, but not good enough to make up for the poor service.  I can get bad attitude at a million places in DC, so I prefer to spend my money at the restaurants where customers are appreciated and made to feel like guests, not impositions.  Too bad, though.

To start, salads that, in my opinion, were overdressed with dijon vinaigrette, leaving the lettuce leaves limp.

Then we split the fall squash risotto with ""velvet"" mushrooms, which we both found verged on undercooked. I'm well aware that risotto requires somewhat of an artful preparation, and it's tough to get the texture just right, but the flavor wasn't singing either.

We ordered two very promising sides to go along with the risotto: pureed sweet potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts with balsamic glaze and pecans. The sprouts sorely lacked the fall-apart goodness I've had at other spots and required too high a degree of fork-jabbing. The sweet potatoes were actually the highlight of the meal--creamy, elegantly spiked with butter and something faintly brown-sugary.

The restaurant concept itself is fantastic. I really enjoy the minimal decor, the exposed brick and the stone bar. The whole place is understated, which is an approach that I certainly welcome to Capitol Hill (restaurants or otherwise!). Some of the food is great. The wine is of good quality, but the wine list is not extensive for a place that holds itself out to be a wine bar. 

HOWEVER, the staff and management are entirely lacking. I've had both good and bad, friendly and rude service. The real problem, though, seems to be that the casual, understanded style seems to extend to the staff's interactions with diners. That's a problem for me and totally detracts from the otherwise great restaurant.

This opinion stems mostly from one experience: knowing that Sonoma is a small restaurant that has a tendency to close up shop whenever the hell it feels like it, I once called to confirm the kitchen would be open at 9 o'clock that evening. After being assured it would, and specifically told I didn't need a reservation, I arrived with my date to be informed by a very frost lady that the kitchen was closed. I explained that I had called; she responded that they use an outside answering service, therefore--not her problem. Because I persisted, they accomodated, but not without making it clear what a burden it was because the kitchen had been wiped down, yada yada... Needless to say I ordered tons of unusual food and stayed for a very, very long time! Jk...but I did have words with the lady before I left, partially to thank her for accomodating, but also to reiterate that when a customer is told something important (i.e. we are either open or we're not) it is the responsibility of the restaurant to react accordingly.

We started off with some wine and cheeses. The waiter was helpful in recommending chesses and wine. However, make sure you specify what size glass you want or you will automatically get the full glass. I like that they offer a half glass that way you can try more wines. 

For the main course two of us got the dried aged beef burger and the other got the mussels. The beef burger was really good and juicy and the potatoes that came as the side were great.

But every once in a while I want just plain Americanish food that is fresh, well prepared and tastes good.  So, as one of the few places on the Hill that provides some thing other than ethic food or doesn't feel as though (or smells) your sitting in a frat house, I really, really want to like Sonoma.  Especially given my addiction to cheese and love of wine.  But, I find that while the cheese and wine selection are quite good and that the food is fresh and has good flavor.....I'm just not crazy about or planning frequent visits to Sonoma.  

Why? Overall I rate it as good, but not great.  First, while I really like the decor (e.g. the exposed brick, the colors, lighting etc.), the lower level is very noisy.  On each occasion I have eaten at Sonoma I've felt that I have had to practically yell to talk to the people I'm eating with...the last dinner, it was just a friend and me sitting less than 3 feet away from one another.  Secondly, while the prices are not extraordinary it can be pricey both for the wine & food, especially if you are with someone who actually has an appetite such as my boyfriend.   

I'm always looking for good value for my money.  Having eaten at some of the nicest (& priciest) places in DC, my expectations are set by the price points on the menu.  If I'm paying $14 for a single crab cake (as an appetizer), it had better be one darn good crab cake, the service excellent and the location pleasant (highly recommend the crab cakes at Blue Duck Tavern).  And, the prices at Sonoma can be a bit pricey if your eating more than the smaller portions and/or if your pairing with wine.  If you have a decent appetite there are better choices in the city for this type of food and setting.  Though maybe not on the Hill at this time :(

Service was acceptable, but no more than that. On the whole, a very middling experience for what looks like a swanky place.

2713,Sonoma Restaurant & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=AWjkzpWvoL0UAT55ldvBuw,"I tried Sonoma for a late lunch, and my only goal was to try their burger, which a couple of Yelpers have mentioned is good.  The place was virtually empty, and a really sweet girl seated me.  After toying with the idea of getting a plate from the primi (the pumpkin risotto and pork croquettes both looked good) before the burger, I decided against it, knowing that the burger would be more than enough food for lunch.  I was definitely right.  

First off, I am offended by the fact that you have to pay for bread and olive oil at Sonoma.  Perhaps dinner is different, but on the lunch menu bread and olive oil cost $5. Five dollars?  At a nice restaurant?  I'm as much a fan of the deconstruction (read: requiring someone to pay for each element separately, of which Tom Colioccio's Craft in NYC is a famous example) of a meal as the next guy, but this is taking it too far.  

Anyway, I ordered the burger, medium, with gorgonzola.  After about fifteen minutes, my meal arrived, and I was generally happy with the sandwich.  The burger came with the molten gorgonzola (on top of the meat) exposed and the bun, lettuce, tomato and onions (and mushrooms too I believe?) sitting on the other side of the plate.  Because the onions/mushrooms were on top of the top-half of the sandwich, flipping it over without spilling them everywhere ended up being an impossible task.  So after constructing my sandwich, I bit into it... and sweet, dripping gorgonzola poured out of the backside.  This great escape, however, did not detract from the fact that the burger was very, very good.  Actually, I take that back.  The molten gorgonzola was very, very good.  The burger, with the mediocre toasted brioche bun, the somewhat-dry meat, the bland mushrooms and onions, and normal lettuce/tomato, was fine.  The gorgonzola is what really made the burger good.  

At $21 (after tax and tip), not good enough though.  I doubt I'll be back for lunch, though it's probably worth a try.  My search for an amazing burger continues.

I am assuming by naming your restaurant Sonoma, you would be suggesting California-fresh foodie fare. And they do - to an extent. The ingredients seem fresh enough, but nothing really had any taste. My husband had the pesto pizza and for as good as it looked, it didn't taste like much. I had the ricotta gnocchi and I had the same conclusion. Nice presentation, lacking on taste. They same is to be said about the cheese plate (which we let the waiter pick) and the dessert. The bibb salad and the meatballs were actually good and quite tasty.

Secondly, a lot of the wine was from out of the country. If you are going to have a restaurant named Sonoma, wouldn't you feature a lot of wines from the Napa/Sonoma area? Or at least some out of Washington state? They could get more local wines from VA. But they had stuff from France, Spain, South America which I thought was a little ridiculous considering the vibe I assumed the restaurant was going for. My glass of wine was $18, because I was trying to stick to CA wines.

The location is very convenient for those who work on the Hill, as it is only a couple blocks from the Capitol South Metro. The ambiance was rustic and simplistic -- brick walls, plain tables and chairs, and dim lighting.

The wine list was nice -- decent selection at a range of price points; from the very reasonable to the a little pricier.  We had a mild red --can't remember the name of it to save my life, but it was pretty good.  The waitress was very knowledgeable about both the wine list and the dining menu.

We started with Oyster's Rockefellar - delicious!  Such a great twist on the dish.  We had a cheese board as well -- the cheese was nice but overpriced in my opinion.  $11 for a cube of cheese not much bigger than the ones you see on your run of the mill cheese and cracker party platters.  For the main course, I had the skate and my friend had fish as well.  My friend's meal was decent, but my skate was much better.  A little on the salty side, but it wasn't overwhelming. Not easy to find skate on many menus.  

Overall, it was a nice experience.  I gave it 3 stars bc although it was nice, I was not wowed in any way. Would I go back? Probably not...unless I'm leaving work late and too hungry to go home and cook. Eh, I take that back.  If I'm that Hungry, I'll just go to Tortilla Coast instead.

There is a nice selection of wine and I like the way the wine list is organized by grouping wines into categories like fruit forward reds, big reds, etc...  I also like the cheese and charcuterie plates you can get.  There are something like 12 different cheeses and 6 different meats you can get in groups or all at once.  I really like the local produce and the use of in season, local vegetables with all the entrees.  The beet salad with goat cheese was quite good, but not as good as the beet salad at Viridian.  We had the pizza which I do highly recommend.   You get to order either a white, green (pesto) or red pizza and then choose your cheese(s) and other toppings like prosciutto, white anchovies, forest mushrooms, olives, etc...  Another thing I might try next time is that they have first plates like Risotto and Linguine Carbonara that come as small plates, but can be doubled to make an entree.  My only complaint was that the service was a little off.  My wife ordered half glasses of wine twice and twice got a full glass instead, not a big deal, but part of the draw of the place is that you can order half glasses and try more wines.

WHY-
Next to my place 
Great brunch for a great price
Nice change of pace for the area
Cute atmosphere
Lots of wine

WHY NOT-
Service. I kind of feel like every time I go here (which was only twice) I am being a nuisance. It just feels like they do not like me for some reason. Not sure...because I have never seen anyone that works there my entire life. So, I found it to be a little awkward and almost a little tense for some reason.

The first time I went here (a little while ago) was for brunch with a group of 6. There was a yelp review that explained how they were treated poorly at brunch, which was a relief to read, bc I know it wasn't anything personal. I would agree with her review in saying...don't serve brunch? Hello? That aside, the food was excellent and the drinks were just as delicious (and bottomless mimosas for $10 is great!). No one else at the table seemed to notice the service that felt like we were being punished for having fun, but I found it hard to ignore. I decided I wouldn't return bc it wasn't really worth the awkwardness.

Then, I saw a Groupon for a wine flight and I thought that would be fun and possibly a different experience from brunch. So, we went the other night and it was pretty much more of the same. We were seated at the bar, totally cool, bc we were just doing the flights and my friend grabbed a quick bite. We explained to the guy behind the bar that we didn't know much about wine (hoping to learn a thing or two) and his response was a blank stare. Not like, OH OK, well do you like this, that, X, Y, Z etc. So...we ended up picking two and telling him to put whatever he would recommend for the rest. Which he did, but I thought he would explain maybe something, no. Nothing.

COOL. Next, we drank the wine and had a fun time. The wine was good, but I still felt this weird pressure to leave. When we did, my friend asked if I felt like they hated us. Which, yes. 

SO it is possible that I am not cool enough to dine here. I will work really hard on my coolness and maybe try again in the future! Fingers crossed for me, people!!

I orderd the eggs benedict, and correct me if I'm wrong fellow brunch-lovers, but THE BEST part of any Eggs Benedict is popping the runny egg and sopping it up with your remaining english muffin. Right? Well NO BUENO here - the eggs were COOKED. They were soft-boiled! I was so tempted to return them but because it had taken so long food to come out, I went ahead and ate. I was starving.  The canadian bacon was great. The meal also came with a small side of yogurt & granola - yum.

The space was adorable. I loved the concrete bar top.  However, their entire kitchen was one corner of the bar space and had no exhaust fan so the entire place filled up with cooking smoke (not thick black smoke or antyhing) and made my eyes burn and water. 

The staff, although fairly polite, was not friendly. I felt like I was bothering them (similar to what one reviewer said on here!!) - especially the manager or supervisor. I prefer a bit more of a chatty/talkative staff. Give me some small talk before my food comes out.

It took me after 3 times of our waiter asking if we were ready to order to finally make a decision. When I narrowed down my options I was left to choose between the French toast and the Enchiladas.

So let me get started by saying Vinoteca is a very pretty restaurant with a lovely patio setting in the front and an awesome backyard courtyard equipped with a bar, tables, and a bocce ball court. 

I am at brunch on a Saturday mornin' right when it opens at 11:00 AM and am seated outside. I get the bottomless mimosas which were given to me in a wine glass not flute (good move, Vinoteca) and pretty champagne heavy which was a pleasant surprise. I ordered the Duck Confit Benedict and it was a bit too heavy for my taste. There was way too much Hollandaise on the eggs which really overpowered the dish and made the bread soggy. I did enjoy the duck, especially since it was tossed with a light salad which helped balance the fattiness of the confit. My friend got the Steak and Eggs Poutine and he enjoyed it. 

A few other things to note, there have been changes in the price. Some other reviews say that bottomless mimosas cost $10 but when I went it was $18, however once you reach the two-hour time limit, you are free to take your glass to the backyard to continue drinking (a great way to spend your Saturday afternoon). There have also been negative comments regarding service but my waitress was awesome. She continually refilled my mimosas without me needing to flag her down and was very attentive the whole time.

However, I would recommend just going for their happy hour when the weather is pleasant enough to enjoy their backyard beer garden. The area out back may not be big, but if you can snag a comfortable spot, it's hard not to be charmed by the bocce ball court, wine bar, and pleasant ambiance.

I've experienced their dinner inside as well, and while I was content with the bison short rib, I wasn't blown away like I've been with other short rib dishes in the area. The volume level of the restaurant was a bit overwhelming on the Saturday night we were there, which just strengthens my recommendation to come for their outside offerings.

The brunch menu sounded amazing, and I liked all of the different options.  I wasn't in the mood for anything too rich, so I opted for coffee, the english muffin sandwich and side of egg whites.  I am a sucker for sautéed mushrooms, so I also shared an order of sautéed mushrooms with my friend.  The sandwich comes with a fried egg, ham and cheddar, but I opted out of the cheddar.  The sandwich was okay.  The english muffin was a little too soft for me and the size of the sandwich was on the smaller side.  But my coffee was always refilled, which was great.  

The ham, the mushrooms and the side salad that came with my sandwich were all pretty good, and everyone else seemed to really enjoy their food (the mushroom omlets were a hit, eggs and cauliflower, the french toast looked amazing and very big).  However, one of my friends did not get what she ordered and our waitress admittedly said it was her fault; that she entered in the wrong dish, so my friend had to wait for her correct order while we all had our food.  She also forgot to the side of ham one of my friends ordered, which was then brought out later.

I have to say that the food is mediocre and the wine is the main event.  In the future, I think I would go specifically for drinks and maybe dine elsewhere.  My friend ordered a ""Spanish flight"" of wine and I ordered both a red and a rose to accompany my meal.  I wish I remembered the names / types of the wines I ordered, but both were very good (that much I can say with confidence!).  The wine experience was pretty on point.

Food-wise, we decided to go for an appetizer and some entree dinner options.  The flatbread they serve complimentary tasted somewhat funky and strange... not sure if I'd want to eat that again.   We ordered raspberry scones as an appetizer.  They served 3 of them and they came with ""Pennsylvania butter.""  The scones were too dry and there was something funky about the butter or the scone because it made my throat constrict a bit and it was not a pleasant feeling.  Even later that evening as I went to bed, my throat was still feeling oily and unpleasant.  Not sure why... As for food, I decided to order the Vino Cheddar Burger (Caramelized Onion, Aïoli, Dill Pickle).  I have to say that I was not impressed with this burger.  It was $16 and totally not worth it.  The burger was pretty flat (more toppings would be nice) and tasted pretty plain.  I did like that they substituted the hand-cut fries with salad.  I was already feeling too greasy to have fries in addition.  My friend ordered a cheese plate and a Mushroom Crostini.  She seemed to enjoy her food.  Overall, I was not impressed with the food.  Not super fresh and nothing to really wow you. 

But our service was great - Our server was really nice and gave us some great recommendations for things to order.  He also gave us suggestions for wines, but didn't seem pushy about it, which I appreciated.

Note - the bathrooms are awful!  They seriously do not maintain the bathrooms well, which is telling for a place, especially one that purports to be classy like Vinoteca.  

I liked that it wasn't too crowded on the day we visited and we had a proper farewell meal for my friend.  In the future, I might come during happy hour to take advantage of their specials and I will likely skip the food in future visits.

In short:
-The wine was fantastic and lived up to its ""Vinoteca"" name.
-The food was not impressive and something I'd likely skip in the future.

Inside was crazy loud, but sitting outside in front of the restaurant is a very pleasant place to be as the wine and sun both grow lower. I like this neighborhood. The menu, though, tends towards the heavier and fried - not much for those trying to eat less meat and cheese. The Nosh Trio (Tapenade, Preserved Tomatoes, Roasted Garlic, French Baguette) was very good, especially the tapenade. the Boquerones Fritos (anchovies, breaded and fried, served with house made and very tasty catsup and tartar sauce) was unusual but the sauces were really necessary, the Jambalaya Fries not very memorable to me (a fancier dish than chili fries, but still the same concept of goopy stuff on fries), and Chesapeake Blue Crab Risotto was good enough, but the raw leeks overpowered the taste of the crab. Next time I'm there I'll try Beets and Romanesco (with Coconut Milk, Shallot, Orange, and Mint) and have the Nosh Trio again, and if still hungry try the Potato Portobello Torta (with Red Pepper Parmesan Fonduta and Truffle Oil).

2997,Vinoteca,/user_details?userid=Sedv6r9U0Dae1Cd93bRnXw,"I went to Vinoteca for dinner on New Year's Eve recently. We had a mixed experience, but the restaurant was accommodating to our various requests.

We were a group with varying dietary restrictions (one vegan, two vegetarians, one who doesn't eat red meat), so we tried to find a place that didn't have a prix fixe menu. Open Table said that you would be able to order a la carte from the regular menu or items from a special menu on NYE. Their website also said nothing of a special prix fixe menu, and when they left a message to confirm the reservation, they mentioned nothing of the prix fixe menu. However, when we arrived at the restaurant and sat down, we were told that only the prix fixe menu would be available that night, and that they had not updated Open Table (oops). The waiter did not know the price of the prix fixe menu. The manager did come over, informed us of the menu price, and checked with the chef about my dietary restrictions (vegan). We just wish that the prix fixe menu had been made more clear - I did not see it on their website (which I did check before making a reservation), and Open Table said the exact opposite of what we were told when we got to the restaurant, though apparently it was advertised on social media (which I did not check). The chef was able to accommodate my diet, so we decided to stay. Our friends coincidentally also had reservations that night and were not aware of the prix fixe menu.

The next hiccup came when two of my fellow diners informed our waiter that they are both vegetarian while ordering. The appetizer round was just listed as ""snacks"" on the menu, so my friend asked if any of the snacks were vegetarian. The waiter basically said that only one wasn't vegetarian, but when the snacks came out, it turned out that most of them were not vegetarian (the rest had fish, chorizo, and other meat). The waiter did later realize his error after my friends informed him again that they are vegetarians, and he brought them the same snack that I had received for that course.  

The restaurant does get points for their accommodation. I am grateful that the restaurant was able to accommodate both my dietary restriction. In addition, they did make an accommodation for one member of our party who arrived late to dinner due to a delayed flight and allowed him to order a dish from the bar menu since he couldn't order the full dinner. 

Overall, I thought the cocktails that night were the highlight of the meal. The food for me was pleasant enough, but nothing special, though I was grateful to the chef. My friends all seemed to enjoy the gnocchi dish the most. I think the dessert (sorbet) was my favorite dish of the night. Though there were a lot of courses, I didn't feel particularly full. Yes, I understand that the chef was probably not prepared to cook a vegan 5 course meal that evening, but I also was not expecting to eat a 5 course meal, or would have chosen a different place to eat. I had done my research (Open Table and the restaurant's website), just apparently not a Facebook. Oh well, we all survived, ate, and drank.

The service was also on the slow side, which wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that we had tickets to see a show (we were sat to eat nearly 2 hours before our dining experience was over - we missed the first 3 songs). We ordered a bottle of wine, 10 minutes later our glasses were brought out, 15 minutes after that we were brought our wine.

It looks like it's an extension of the tavern on the corner, but it is not. 

So this place is definitely for the older crowd. It's a wine bar and they have a very extensive list to pick from.  I started with the mulled wine (because I was freezing) and the Chef's special cheese and chauterie plate.  It was very good, but nothing too special. The mulled wine was excellent! I've never had it out at a restaurant. 

After that I went for the Guigal Cotes de Rhone (based on Yelp suggestions) and I thought it was ok.  It was a bit oaky for me, but still good.  I think I could warm up to it. 

Don't expect large plates for your meal here.  If you are hungry I suggest you go for the Prixe fixe menu where you get an appetizer, meal, and a dessert for $35.  The truffle bean soup was good and I the swordfish was tasty as well.  But my favorite has got to be the tres leche with Guiness ice cream.  YUM!  One of the reasons why I liked it so much was because it was not very sweet.

Service was OK.  They weren't really prompt, and they seem a bit understaffed when the place started to get busy.  Maybe they are not used to being this busy?

First of all, our waiter did a wonderful job at suggesting wines and provided such a wonderful service. We started with charcuterie: prosciutto di parma and duck prosciutto, accompanied with manchego cheese with figs and pecans. The meats were wonderul - served with a grainy mustard and parmesan crisps. We also had some small plates - a grilled calamari and seared scallop. Although the dishes were delicious, the portions were small. Considering the seared scallop small plate was $10, it only came with one scallop!

The disappointment took a larger downward spiral when our entrees came out. I ordered the duck breast and the Captain had the fish of the day - a grilled yellowfin tuna. We were impressed with our dishes thus far, that when we started to eat our entrees, we couldn't help but notice a decreased quality and poor execution. My duck breast was tough - not tender at all, and was soaking in a very salty sauce. The Captain's yellowfin was just flat out boring and bland.

We wrapped up the meal with seasonal sorbet - 3 types of sorbet in cantaloupe, lychee, and something else that I couldn't pinpoint by flavor. It was a pleasant and refreshing end to the meal.

My years of fine experience in the food service industry also has given me insight into how the restaurant industry works.   I have been a hostess, a server, a barback, and a bartender.  I worked my way up the food service food chain.  I know what is correct, and what sounds asinine.  For that reason, I'm going to stick with 3 stars.

My first experience here was on a Wednesday or Thursday night right after I moved here with some guy whose name I can't even remember.  We enjoyed the happy hour specials and possibly got some food.  Obviously that experience wasn't that memorable, with the exception of the fact that this place got PACKED.

Last night I came back, because when I searched for ""patio"" to take a guy I DO remember, I figured U Street would be a good place in case we wanted to cruise around later.  Being the overly controlling person that I am, I made reservations online through OpenTable.  I could only get 9 p.m., but figured I could arrive early just in case something opened up.  

When I arrived around 8:30, I saw a table on the patio, just waiting for me.  SWEET VICTORY!  But when I went in to check in with the hostess,  was told that because there were only two of us, we'd have to wait until a two-top opened up and couldn't sit at the four-top.  What.  The.  Feck.  There was no line.  It wasn't that busy.  Why couldn't they have sat us at a table that seats 4, instead of making us wait?  I have no idea.  No earthly idea.  If it was packed, I completely understand.  Seating parties is like a puzzle.  You have to think ahead to where you're going to seat people.  But as there was no wait, I don't see why we couldn't have been sat immediately.  When we were sat, it was at a two-top, back in the corner next to a group of extremely vapid and annoying girls when there were a number of empty four tops that we walked by.  Not the best place to try and be memorable.

The bartender, however, was fabulous.  I got the bubble bath and he got a glass of cool sounding Spanish red.

Our server was good, but not to the level of the bartender.  

We got the Chef's meat and cheese plate thing, the pan con tomate, the beef jerky stuff, and a couple of more cheeses.  Everything was good, although I would have liked a little more tomato flavor with the thing that is supposed to have tomatoes in it.

I continued to try wine (great wine selection) while he moved on to delicious cocktails like the U Street Mule and the fig thing.  Both were good, although the fig drink was a standout.

The vegetarian and I came here mostly just to booze it up for $10, and each of the drinks (Bellinis, Mimosas, Kir Royales) was quite tasty.  But they were super slow to refill glasses, and even when they did, half the time they didn't fill them up completely.  It's all you can drink, and guess what, I can drink more than that!

The food we got was pretty decent (and only $10-12 per entree!) and really is the only reason they're getting a third star...but we also got all the meat on the side which means I had a double portion on both of my half meals.  Muahahaha!  If you asked the vegetarian, she'd probably give it one star for having only two non-sweet veg option on the menu: a cheese omelet or a bagel sandwich.  And speaking of sweet options, only two and they were both so boring (pancakes or french toast) we avoided them.  What we did get:
**** Pan Con Tomate & Eggs: two eggs sunny-side-up, tomato pulp, chorizo de revilla, manchego cheese served with salad.  Tomato and cheese were negligible.  The chorizo was more reminiscent of pepperoni.  
***** Eggs Benedict Vinoteca: two poached eggs on gruyere toast, hollandaise, frisée salad, duck confit, roasted garlic vinaigrette.  The duck is served on the vinaigrette tossed salad and was fabulous.  The better of the two items.

However, the most memorable part of Vinoteca was the super shitty service.  Got seated and waitress took our drink orders: two bottomless and two waters.  After 15 minutes we flagged down someone to ask for water and got a snarky attitude in return, but got water 5 minutes later.  Another 10 minutes passed and the waitress came to our table looking super confused with our drinks and water...how do they already have water!?  Yeah, THIRTY minutes for the waitress to bring water.  Half an hour when we were sitting outside with the sun beating down on us.  You can imagine what happened when we asked for pepper.

I'd go back if I was looking to drink an early afternoon away, but I'd get there super early so I could actually use the bottomless part of the bottomless drinks.  Otherwise, I'll try other places that you don't have to give written instructions for the waitress to serve you.

3062,Vinoteca,/user_details?userid=s2c7-9bqMhjA8POuKIHm8g,"In my opinion, it is one of the best places to go to for Brunch in DC. What's not to love about it?! Their number one selling point has to be there Bottomless Mimosa  special during brunch. It's actually not just mimosas- it's Mimosas, Bellinis and Kir Royales for only $10. If you don't know what a Kir Royale is, I don't either; but I think it is made with some type of black current liqueur and sparkling wine.

You do not need to make a reservation to dine here for Brunch, but I would strongly recommend it. It tends to get really crowded in here around 11:30, so without a reservation, it may be harder to get a table- especially if you have a big group. Also note that the restaurant is on the small side, so don't expect some huge dining room. There is a lot of space at the bar though, both inside and outside (the outside being the preferred location during the warmer months).

Now, I know you're probably wondering what the catch is and there is one, of course: the food. Of course you can't have $10 unlimited drinks AND cheap food because, you know, that would be like highway robbery.  Now, the food isn't super expensive, but it's not McDonald's cheap either. Most Brunch items are around $10-12; now that wouldn't be bad at all if the portions weren't so small, so you end up ordering a few items from the menu (especially after being there for 2+ hours taking full advantage of the bottomless drinks). Also, I find it a little annoying that the only side that the breakfast sandwiches come with is salad and you cannot substitute for a different side (such as potatoes- which cost an additional $4 to an already $12 breakfast sandwich) Nevertheless, I still recommend for everyone to try this Brunch at some point... just to say that you did it. If you do go, keep in mind that I am always looking for another excuse to go back ;)

We chose Vinoteca primarily because they had a Flamenco dancer and the dinner was a special treat for a friend who used to be a Flamenco dancer.  I chose the shrimp plate while the others ordered more shrimp, duck and a sandwich.  I could see my friend struggling to cut the duck with what was just an ordinary knife.  At first I said ""are you sure it isn't steak?""  A steak knife would have been a better choice.  I was enjoying my shrimp dish - it wasn't anything to write home about and the shrimp were more the size of scampi.  When I was halfway through my portion, I noticed a fly walking along my knife.  I could not believe it.  I put the knife on the table next to me and the fly just stayed on it.  One of the busboys came and took it away and I pointed to the fly and he just laughed.  I think the laugh was more of a way of dealing with not understanding what I said to him perhaps because he didn't speak English.  I don't think he meant any disrespect.
After the fly incident, I lost my appetite but tried hard to conceal the incident from the two women in our company.  My brother did see it though.  When we were leaving, I noticed there was a lovely patio and bar a the back of the premises - our waitress, although very nice and sweet, did't tell us about this and only offered us the front porch or inside.

This is a good spot to meet up with friends and coworkers. But, as a date venue, I can't recommend it if you have above-average expectations. Admittedly, I'm just frustrated that a date that I was hoping would go well (didn't), and Vinoteca is just the hepless pinata that's going to be beaten to submission in this review. 

Wine- 3.5/5
Above-average selection. I enjoyed my pinot noir. Our waitress sorta went carte blanche on choosing wines and had difficulty conveying the nuances between different wines or recommending one based on my preferences.
Happy hour specials apply ONLY if you're seated at the bar.  

Food- 2/5 
Fried Potatoes-- I expected massive potato wedges topped with tons of duck sausage and cheese. Instead the potatoes are french fries and the duck sausage and mozarella is sort of scantily placed around the fries. Basically, they're dressed-up duck fat fries.

Fried Mussels-- I wouldn't recommend these. Over-cooked, small-sized, not fresh, and just drenched in oil. 

Overall, I can't really recommend Vinoteca as a spot where you can get a solid bite to eat. Menu is rather limited in selection. 

Service- 3/5
It's really difficult to carry on a deep conversation with your date when three different people approach you throughout dinner (and at multiple times) asking you how everything is. Suddenly, the flow of your conversation is interrupted, you have to divert your attention from just when your date was about to explain how she managed to avoid from falling off a mountain. It's akin to pausing a movie in the middle of an epic Morgan Freeman monologue,
 
Besides, what is the point of asking ""How are you doing?"" 
We're doing fine. I'm not collapsed, I'm not bleeding, no one's vomiting, and no one is screaming. If everything looks normal and fine-- please don't keep asking. Please stop repeatedly and abruptly inserting yourself if it appears that we are deep in conversation. If I need something, I will let you know. But, now that you've interrupted our conversation, everything is NOT fine. 

Smoking- 
Vinoteca chooses not to ban smoking within 25 feet of the restaurant. Thus, if you're seated in the outdoor patio, just have to deal with others' cigarettes.

We have been several other times for happy hour with friends inside and outside.  We have been to Sunday Night Flamenco twice, which is always enjoyable (and not to mention all Spanish wines are half off during Flamenco).  The happy hour prices are great and food portions are very fair.  Some of the food does not blow my mind, but it never disappoints.  The last group of friends we brought with us included 4 vegetarians and they were quite disappointed with the food options for them.  There were not many vegetarian choices on the happy hour menu, and although there were more on the regular menu, they were not willing to pay the overly high price for those items.  My husband and I personally enjoy the small plate happy hour prices.  And the best thing of all is that they have happy hour EVERY DAY!

My friend had the omelet and said it was good. The duck benedict was truly fantastic -- in fact, I thought the eggs themselves, and the delicious toast underneath, were so good that the duck and frisee were almost unnecessary. The currant scones were simply unbelievable. Buttery, flaky, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. The drinks weren't anything special, but they were fine for $3 each.

What was not so good was the service. I was a little late, so my friend went ahead of me and sat at the bar. When she got there, she noted that we wanted to sit outside when I arrived. When I got there, though, no one seemed to know what was going on, and it was a few minutes before we could even get someone's attention to get seated. The place opened at 11 and at 11:15 there were at least three people rushing back and forth from the host station and seeming a little overwhelmed.

We did get a table on the patio, but then we waited a very, very long time before anyone saw to us. In fact, we watched a table being set up near us, had a party sit down there, and saw them get their drinks before our waiter even approached us. At one point before the waiter came, the host came over and said something to the effect of the waiters were just finishing with their ""table assignments"" inside and would be with us shortly? We were definitely confused and a little put off. It wasn't until we actually turned and flagged down a busboy that we got a waiter. He also seemed a little new/overwhelmed and tried to excuse the service by saying things were ""hectic,"" which was odd, as it was still relatively quiet. 

He also struggled with carrying our drink orders over; to be fair, the glasses were dangerously full. I actually ended up taking mine off the tray for him and spilled some in the process. Finally, once we were done, we waited another eternity for the check, and again had to flag someone down to get it. In total, we were there for about 90 or 100 minutes, and not because we were lingering over a leisurely meal. Frankly, I couldn't eat fast enough once the food got there, I was so hungry (and a little hangry). It would have been nice if they'd supplied something to start with (or brought out the scones before the rest of the meal?). It also would have been nice if they'd comped us something since they knew we were getting subpar service, although we certainly paid full price and tipped a reasonable amount.

I frequented the bar quite often back in 2008-2009 when my friend was a server there.  Took a little break for a couple years and now I'm finding myself there more often again.  Joining a bocce league that plays there once a week probably had something to do with it?  

Short story long, I've had fantastic times at Vinoteca.  I'm always impressed with the service and one time a delicious burger kept me standing after too much sangria.  So why just A-OK?   Because for the first time, I brunched at Vinoteca.  

Without a doubt, five stars for service.  Michael was a really great server and took great care of me while I waited for my tardy brunch partner.  I ordered the current scones because I was really hungry and didn't want to just stare at my phone or the room full of ladies who brunch while I waited.  They were absolutely delicious.  Amazing.  Would order them again in a heartbeat.  Unfortunately, they are the only things about the meal that I enjoyed.  

I don't know why but the steak & eggs were calling out to me and I went for it.  The steak was cooked how I ordered (medium-rare) and was covered in some sort of pesto sauce which just didn't hit it for me.  And the eggs - I think they were scrambled, or something?  It was just a blob of eggs, no seasoning or flavor.  The mixed greens salad was exactly that.  The meal  was a solid... two stars.

I like the brightness of this place- the red, black, and white tile behind the bar gives is a refreshing change from the dark, brick, candlelit look that has become the standard in much of DC.  As for the food - while I haven't been bowled over by anything, it's all pretty good - standard wine bar fare, including cheese plates, charcuterie, olives, etc.  The arugula salad with shaved parmesan and grapefruit is nice, and the sliders, after looking around, seem to be one of their most popular plates.  You can choose from beef, lamb and feta, tuna, or portabello sliders - three of which I've tried, and are pretty tasty.  

I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means - usually I'll ask for a recommendation and try something I haven't had before, so I can't really speak to the quality of selection.  What does bum me out though is the lack of descriptions under each choice, which I always find interesting and helpful when choosing a wine.

There's also a tempting cocktail menu--I want to try one next time I'm here.

Food: We shared three cheeses and the jamon Iberico--all very good. Portions were just right.  We wanted the pate but they were out of it. The scallops with mushrooms were delicious. Plump, sweet scallops, nicely seared. I adore mushrooms so this dish made me very happy. What didn't make me happy was the puddle of oil those yummy mushrooms were swimming in. The sticky toffee pudding was luscious, sweet and comforting.

Service: pretty good. Our server was very nice. She made a good wine suggestion when I was stuck on a third one to add to my flight. Unfortunately, she didn't show the same good judgment later in our meal. We were still finishing our main course when she came to our table. My friend literally had fork in hand, about to take another bite from the dish when our waitress attempted to remove it. Rather than just returning in a minute or asking if we were done, she said something like ""I'll let you grab the last bite!"" and then hovered while my friend awkwardly tried to spear some mushrooms under the waitress's impatient gaze. Not the best way to end our meal. I understand if she wanted to move things along but she could have handled the situation with a bit more finesse.

Good wine selection. The noms were good. Great service from everyone but the hostess. The servers and everyone else made it pleasant.

Why I only gave 3 stars and not 5: The hostess.

Will I be back here again? Maybe, but apparently not yet.

This isn't a character judgment of the hostess. I think she was just probably 'off her game' that night, but I saw another review posted the day after her birthday, September 12th, also complaining about the hostess. So I think we dealt with the same woman.

First of all, it wasn't even full or that busy when we arrived. I had reservations for a table of 4 and asked if we could sit outside since there were multiple tables free. She seemed a bit odd about this.

I originally mentioned when I called in days in advance that we would have at least 8 people eventually, but they only had openings for a table of 4 on the night of. They said that they would have no problem accommodating more if possible, and I said we would work with that and continue the night elsewhere if they were still full.

We're outside, and there are multiple tables free. They weren't full at any point. We ask about taking over two tables. (2 more people had arrived for a total of 6, and 3 more were on the way.)

The hostess becomes perceptively annoyed and even mentions that there's going to be a $35 min. I don't really get it. It's the hostess' job to keep the bottles flowing and the tables full. And they weren't having any luck out front keeping them full; the entire time a couple had been empty.

The hostess seated us immediately at a great table. The waiter came right away to bring menus, water and fabulous crunchy bread. I love bread that has ""little middle"" if you will, and a crunchy exterior... Points scored there. We started with 3 different appetizers. Since this place has great charcuterie....we sampled the Lomo ( kind of like Bresaolo) , the Duck proscuitto  and the Tome des Recollettes ( a wonderful French cheese laced with Sauterne wine and herbs)And the best part...they served this with yummy little cornichons and crisps.  We ordered a simple, dry white Italian wine....Nothing special but in our price range and went so well with our food. 

For the main course, my date ordered the Rabbit Fricasse with mushrooms and  gnocchi all in a rich tarragon cream sauce. I think this was the best one of the three entrees we tried. It was the ultimate comfort food...Not too salty and not drowned in cream sauce.Next we had the Shrimp and Grits...Something I try when its on a menu...and I was not disappointed! Two huge grilled Gambas on a bed of oh so smooth grits and a shrimp bisque-esque sauce. Ok...we had to dip the bread the remaining sauce  so the kitchen would not have to wash this plate!  The last dish was..eh..not so great. I know my Duck Confit and this was not it. It was more of a Corned beef inspired duck. Albeit that is was cooked long and slow..it just was not correct for me.

My boyfriend and I wanted to sit inside because the place has a beautiful space, but the ambiance was ruined by the obnoxious Daddy Yankee music blaring in the background. We sat outdoors, where the uncomfortable crammed-together seating lets you hear the conversations of neighboring diners. It is a wine bar and it should be intimate, just not with other guests. 

Our server was polite and friendly and the food was timely, just not that great. We came here on a Friday night around 9pm and they had run out of Malbec and Empanadas, the two things I was most excited to try! We had several orders of the yucca fries, which tasted decent, but too overpriced for how little was on the plate. The fish tacos were tasty and probably the highlight of the place.

They offer wines by the glass, bottle, as well as flights. We decide to try the different flights.

I found it interesting that Cork opened at 5 on a Saturday but the kitchen didn't open until 5:30.  So, we had to sit at the bar until the kitchen open and then we could be seated at a table.  If you're gonna open, everything should be opened.

We finally got a table.  Our waitress was friendly and prompt.  She had recommended that for a party of four, we should order between 8 to 10 plates.  So, we ordered about 8 plates.  Most were good but some were not shareable portion like the duck confit which came with one small leg.  Uhm, I guess we were supposed to shred a piece off from the leg. 

What really bothered me about the place was that everything was crammed together.  The bar stools are crammed together leaving no elbow room.  There's no space to get in on your stool.  You have to pull out your stool out to the middle of the floor just to get in front and pull up.  There's a table placed right next to the bathroom.

If the answer is ""um.....not much, I can pretty much do that myself if I felt like it"", then you will not especially like Cork Wine bar.

 The reviews below me have all heaped praise on the ""avocado pistachio toasts"" that they serve. And seeing as it's the most lauded dish, it was completely underwhelming and a bit pricy at ten bucks. I'm not saying it wasn't tasty. Ripe avocados + bread + pistachios = happy fun time in my mouth. But it's also something I can make at home, for cheaper, and with the added luxury of not having to put a shirt on before I gobble it down.  I was expecting some sort of restaurant-ey magic that justifies the price point, but it just wasn't there. 

As for the rest of the menu, it's tiny, with some pretty tasty stuff. Nothing really unique per say, and no cohesive sense of a chef even pretending to have a theme, beyond ""all this stuff will taste better with booze"", but tasty nonetheless. I visited for brunch and had the benedict (ehh. Very forgettable) and the cinnamon rolls. I highly recommend the rolls if you are eating here, as they come out warm and ooey and gooey and cinnamon -ey and exactly how cinnamon rolls should be.

3714,Cork Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=D9ULH8p1ZSjHpKJ6HytzYA,"So as a wine bar alone I would totally rate this place 5 stars.  The selection is well chosen and described in a really useful way in the wine list.  The prices are reasonable.  There are unique offerings - on my visit I had a white wine made of a grape I had never heard of from Languedoc - I've never had a wine from Languedoc before, despite having lived next door in Provence - and it was exactly as described on the list, and a perfect pairing with the calamari I ordered off the food menu.  Quite a deal at only $7 a glass imo.

But as a restaurant, this place is 3 stars at best.  They charge what would be the cost of full entrees at a chain restaurant for itty bitty little portions.  And the food is fine - everything we ordered was at least tasty - but not so mindblowing to justify such high prices at such ridiculously small portions.  They pitch the thing as a sharing menu - but how can you share something around the table that's barely enough to produce a single regular appetizer size serving?  I mean SMALL.  The waiter was also fine, seemed to know the wine list and pairings well, but nothing special either.  Bathrooms were decent.  Ambiance is decent.  Everything decent.  But not amazing.  So why the exorbitant prices?

So 3 and 5 averages out to 4, right?  I would have given it 4, but I had to dock it one star specifically for the tortellini.  Or should I say ""tortellini.""  First of all this was a $12 dish - for ""sharing.""  They presented me with 5 tortellinis spaced out in a row on a flat dish.  And these were not oversized, stuffed-to-the-gills tortellinis.  Oh no.  They were miniscule.  Nor were they even really stuffed.  There was some kind of stuffing, like a little smear of it, inside of otherwise flat pasta that had been folded over on itself.  Then to give it the appearance of a tortellini they took the teeny tiny little flat triangle of pasta and shaped it into a ring.  I mean literally a ring, a hollow O of pasta small enough that it probably would have fit a large man's thumb quite nicely.

That's...$2.40 a piece for dinky bits of pasta that would probably each be 2 square inches laid out flat.  And some weeds with dressing.  And it tasted fine but I could probably have gotten pasta that was equally tasty at Olive Garden and I guarantee you I would have gotten more than 5 barely stuffed tortellinis for my $12 there.

I should have sent it back but I was STARVING.  Because nothing is enough to fill you up here.  So I ate my insulting tortellini and even nibbled the weeds.  After the tortellini, a portion of the calamari and the sauteed mushrooms I was still starving.  Finally I had the genius idea to ask for bread (why they don't just have it out automatically I don't know - it seems nobody in DC provides bread at the table anymore).  

Now my desert - a peach and berry crisp - was really delicious, but again, really really small.

In total my share of the bill came to $50 before tip and, granted, that included 2 glasses of wine but the wine was the cheap part.  I shouldn't have to spend $36 on food and still be hungry without the aid of table bread.  And I have a pretty normal sized appetite, it's not like I'm a linebacker.

Then we sat for quite awhile with no waiter introducing himself so we had to flag him down. 

Yes the menu looks reasonably priced but only because you get small servings. I ordered the Strawberry Streusel Muffin (which is normal sized, not meant to be shared as the menu implies) and received a carrot muffin. I told the waiter this and he just quickly took it away without a saying a word. Then he came back and said they no longer have strawberry muffins and that the menu isn't updated, and he failed to tell me that when I ordered it. He didn't bother to ask if I would like something else. I would have kept that muffin had I known there was no other choice.

The roses were mostly average, but not bad. I don't recall all of the dishes we had and for some reason forgot to take pictures of them (there were only 5 or 6 really). The avocado bruschetta was one of my favorites and would order again (must try). It's thin sliced avocado on bread with toasted pistachio, sea salt and olive oil. We also really enjoyed the braised kale with roasted garlic and pecorino. It had the right amount of garlic and salt and cheese. A true standout with an ingredient hard to make awesome.  I also enjoyed the salt roasted local beet salad with pine nuts and feta and we also tried the grilled artichoke. We probably should have stopped there because the last dish we ordered was the grilled mackerel which was only mediocre. There are other things I would try but the menu is on the small side if you're looking for a spot to return to often.

For our hot plates we ordered the Duck Confit which was the highlight of the evening - succulent and juicy.  And the portion was definitely enough to share.  I am very happy that we ordered that dish!  We also ordered the brussel sprouts which were delicious - my fiance doesn't normally eat brussel sprouts but he devoured these.  

Additionally we ordered the brioche sandwich on the recommendation of our waiter.  When it first came out, it was amazingly delicious - buttery and gooey and creamy.  But the draw back was that once it cooled off - which happened in a few minutes - the cheese solidified and the sandwich was no longer as delicious.  So if you order - eat it immediately!

For dessert we enjoyed the flourless chocolate cake - which was just enough and the right size to split and top off the delicious meal.  

Our server was a great server but you could tell he was busy.  He would drop food or drinks and be off to his next thing before we could blink.  I was a little perplexed on the way the food was delivered - our small table for two was not that large and yet we were served a large carving board of three meats (which took up most of the table), our bottle of water and a bottle of wine in a chiller, our silver and bread plates...It was a tight fit.  Then on top of it - they brought out our duck and literally we had to play tetris on our table to fit it on the table.  

Ok so the point of this review is that the food is great, the server was great, the prices were ok , the timing of service could use a little polish and I wish people would dress up a bit.  But if you're headed to DC  and like Tapas - this place is worth your time.  Try it.

Anyway! We my friends and I were pleasantly surprised by Cork for the most part. 
First, as all reviews seem to mention (for good reason): GET THE CINNAMON ROLLS. Maybe get 2 orders. They come out HOT, and are exactly as cinnamon rolls should be, gooey, sticky, doughy. AMAZING. (Definitely a clever gimmick on their part...) 
We then had the toast with avocado, pistachio, pistachio oil, and salt. It was a very simple dish, but was executed well, with a very interesting mix of flavors. It was, however, a very, very small portion (and yes, I know it's a tapas place...) but it seems slightly ridiculous to pay $9 for three slivers of toast. 
We also ordered the baked egg in the parmesan crust with asparagus, goat cheese, Gruyere, mushrooms, etc. It was an tasty mix, and enough for about a bite for each of us. Perhaps more reasonable at $8 because of the ingredients. 
Ordered the Brioche french toast... was not impressed. The tart cherry compote was good but might've complemented another dish better... it didn't go so well with the texture of the french toast/ricotta, and just kind of soaked through it and overwhelmed the flavors. 
Ordered the french fries for no real reason. Unimpressive, very very oily. The house-made ketchup was decent, though not exactly standard Ketchup-flavored. 
I believe we paid ~30 a person with no alcoholic drinks, but we each had coffee, orange juice, etc. I was a bit put-off by the very small drinking glasses and no refills on what wasn't even freshly-squeezed orange juice, pored over a glass nearly full of ice. 
The decor deserves some points though, and I generally don't comment on this, but my friends and I felt like their flatware, plates, etc. were very well-designed and comfortable to use. (Random, I know...)

Get a bigger bar/lounge area, Cork.

Other than that, they only had 4 wine flights (one was a sparkling flight and one was a rose flight, so that was out). I had kind of hoped for more flight options, so that was dissapointing. We ordered a cheese/charcuterie board and that was pretty amazing. I think this could have been a cool place, we weren't too sure though because it was extremely dark inside and we literally had to pick up the candle on the table to read the menu, so that was weird.

Because of this, I ended up trying some plates that were on the less adventurous side, like the asparagus and artichoke dishes. I'm a bit obsessed with artichokes (I used to buy them whole and cook them in college, and my roommates thought I was nuts), and I must say this artichoke dish was pretty boring, but I figured it would be based on the description. It was paired with roasted red peppers, olive tapenade (which tasted a bit like whole-grain mustard to me), and orange slices. The oranges really didn't go with the rest of the plate.

But, on the upside, I did get to have the entire duck confit plate to myself cause my friend will not touch duck with a ten foot pole. The duck itself was great--tender meat and crispy skin. It sat on a bed of spaghetti squash, which was a little bland. 

We had a cheese plate to start. Cork has a small but high-quality selection of cheeses. I also had dessert, the ginger caramel pot de creme with dark chocolate short bread. The shortbread was not great. I'm not very familiar with shortbread, but it was almost rock hard--is that how it's supposed to be? The caramel custard was nothing special. 

I enjoyed my French viogner very much, and our server was very pleasant (and cute too!). I really loved the space--wood ceilings, aluminum piping, and low-lighting. This is a great place for some wine and cheese after work or on a Sunday afternoon for sure. I'd be perfectly happy coming back here and ordering a bit differently to give the food another chance.

It was especially good timing that I got the first glass out of a fresh bottle so it aired out as I was drinking it and it became even more enjoyable as it went along.

The one thing to watch out for is that they close the bar early and don't give you warning that you will be booted out.  We ordered a bottle shortly after midnight, were offered another bottle at 12:30 and then a few minutes later we were given 10 minutes warning that the bar was closing. They then closed 5 minutes after that.

This place is a solid 3.5 stars. I'd give it 4 stars for wine, service, and ambiance and 3 stars for food and price point. I will definitely be coming back, but I'm coming back with a game plan based on the following observations:

The Good: Selection and user-friendly descriptions of the various wines available by the glass and bottle are great. The available 3-wine flights (that change monthly) are also a great way to explore wine themes such as sparkling whites, riojas, etc. I haven't had a bad wine yet, and have had some pleasant surprises. The service was also excellent, even though the place was pretty busy. 

The Okay: The food is okay, nothing spectacular. The rosemary chicken liver bruschetta was pretty tasty, but both this and the avocado pistachio dishes could have used some salt and less bread. The french fries and homemade ketchup were tasty, but the steak was pretty tough and again lacked salt. Overall the prices are what you would expect for the area and a wine bar (about 20% higher than they should be) but the pours are pretty solid and the portions decent enough.

The Plan: Wine bars (or at least the patrons in them) should stick to simple foods and leave the emphasis on the wine, which I will do here in the future. Do I really want anything more than cheese, charcuterie, and bread, or homemade fries, ketchup, and house-cured olives with my wine?  Not really. This is a place to hang out, enjoy wine, and snack on the basics, not a place to have dinner.

We had a couple of glasses of wine while waiting and eventually just grabbed a couple of seats directly at the bar and had our ""meal"" there. The wine list is fairly extensive and not too expensive which is a good combo. So lets get to the food....

We had the following: 
- French fries: Ok, but a little burned which probably killed the sparse seasoning.  Apparently they are known for their french fries, but honestly i have had better at Wendy's and they were not 5 bucks. 
- Avocado: thinly sliced and served over toasted bread with ground pistachios.  Basically tasted like avocado with bread so skip this one. 
- Oil cured roma tomatoes: this are excellent. great dish for when drinking wine. 
- Various cheeses and sliced meats: typical to what you would see at other places.

But I can give an example, epifanio ribera del duero -- not sure of the price by the glass -- but it's just not a very interesting -- or very good -- choice in my opinion.

This is the main issue I have with Cork, and many of the other restaurants in this area recently- the fact that you can't make reservations, or the limitation of reservation-making to certain times (in this instance, Cork only allows you to make reservations for pre-theater dining, between 5:30 and 6:30). We showed up around 6, without a reservation, expecting a wait. We were told at first to wait 5 minutes. After 10 minutes, the host came over and informed us that they had had a big rush (only one couple came in after us) and that it would be a half hour wait. No problem, given the plethora of wine available at the bar. An hour later, however, we were finally seated, at a table that had been vacant the entire time we waited. Not really terrific front-of-the-house service.

However, this minor blip was outweighed by the quality of the meal and the service at our table. After having a terrific wine while waiting at the bar (Colutta, Pinot Grigio del Colli Orientali 2007- $12 a glass, not cheap, but very good), we ordered a bottle of Italian white (was a Pinot, can't remember which one off the top of my head). For the small plates, we ordered as follows:

Oil-Cured Roma Tomatoes with chevre served on grilled bread- these were really fantastic, even for my fiancee, who is not a huge fan of goat cheese. Would highly recommend these on your visit.

Lemon and Black Pepper Dusted Calamari and Rock Shrimp- served with what they term a ""caper remoulade"" it wans't the best calamari I've ever had, but the remoulade made it interesting- it almost tasted like a dill sauce. Being a huge fan of dill, I was a fan of this. Recommend as well.

Grilled Pork Tenderloin- served with a mostarda glaze, braised mustard greens, and fried lemon, this was the least impressive of the three dishes. The pork was cooked nicely and had a nice mix of that grill flavor with the mostarda glaze, but the mustard greens were underwhelming. I had never actually seen fried lemons before, so that was a nice new experience, but they taste pretty much how you would expect fried lemons to taste and didn't really add anything to the dish. I would recommend trying something other than the pork if you were going for a third dish.

After finishing off the bottle of wine, we opted for dessert as well, a course we rarely dabble in at restaurants. The fiancee had the Warm Fig, Raspberry and Almond Crostada, which she said tasted like a ""sugar cookie with raspberry and almonds""- overall a favorable review. My dessert was the Double Chocolate Torte topped chopped hazelnuts. Overall, good flavor, but nothing really to write home about. It reminded me of one of those brownies topped with nuts you buy at 7-11 or a convenience store- not really too inspiring for a $7 dessert.

Our service at the table, by a waitress named Lindsay, was terrific. She was attentive, filled our wine glasses multiple times and had an answer to all our questions. Even though the place filled up shortly after we were seated and we were a party of 2 seated at a 4 top, she didn't rush us one bit, which I for one greatly appreciated (you can always tell when a waiter is trying to get you out of there to get a larger party seated, and it's not a good feeling). I would definitely recommend Cork for a nice, relaxed dinner, but would recommend going early and making a reservation

I was in a party of 12 so you must take into account the kinks that a large party will throw into a server's night. We ordered bottles of wine for our party- all of which were good, and which ranged wildly in price.  We tried to share the small plates but it wasn't as easy as expected. I enjoyed the calamari bites and the mushrooms. Others had the hangar steak and the olives. Nothing stood out as fantastic, and the timing was such that each plate arrived at a different time. So some in my party were eating steak while others had nothing. All in all, I would say only consider this place for a group of 4 or maybe just 2.

Atmosphere:  Nice, but not especially memorable.  Seemed to have a fun, busy bar area which we skipped because we were there for dinner.  We were seated upstairs which was perfect for a quiet, private dinner.  The small table quickly got crowded given the tapas style food plus the tasting options for wine.  The server did her best to time things appropriately, but even so was crowded and awkward.  

Location:  Confusing.  The ""Market and Tasting Room"" is a separate location from the ""Wine Bar.""  Both on the same street, but a block away from each other and on opposite sides of the street.  We of course went (and parked near) the wrong location at first.

Food:  Thought the menu was rather limited, but what we had was delicious.  I had the French red wine flight and my friend had the Spanish white sparkling flight.  Thought it was reasonably priced for good pours of multiple, tasty wines.   Their bread is delicious and very fresh!  We had the avocado with pistachios and sea salt.  Amazing!  The Grilled Angus Flat Iron Steak had an orange marinade that was unexpected, but worked well.   The Organic Chicken Breast was perfectly cooked and probably the most succulent and flavorful chicken I've had at a restaurant in recent memory.

Service:  Was fine.  Again, not memorable.  We were seated right away, but the restaurant wasn't crowded yet...had an early dinner.  Our server did her best to time our dishes appropriately to not have our table overcrowded.  She explained all the wine options for us.

If I'm in the mood for a wine bar again, I'll probably seek out another option next time.  Not that this place was bad, it just wasn't great or all that memorable.

We arrived around 8:15 on Friday night. We expected a wait - that's fine - and were told that we could go to the bar and wait. Umm...where at the bar? I didn't expect a seat, but there was nowhere to stand without being in the way. We were told it would be about 45 minutes so we went over to Masa 14 for a couple of drinks and returned about 35 minutes later. And then we waited...and waited some more. They kept telling us that it would only be a few minutes. An hour and half later, we were seated. At that point, we were already pretty turned off. Like I said, I'm fine with a wait, and also understanding if it's 10-15 minutes above the anticipated wait time. But 45 minutes above...not ok. 

To their credit, the food was really good. We shared 4 plates (steak - cooked perfectly, olives, calamari - incredible sauce!, fries - oh my, so good). We also both had their sparkling wine flight.

3981,Cork Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=yyKjO5kW8VxHCby_bHb1-Q,"I wanted to like this place a lot. I really did. The concept is cute (if a bit trite by now), and the place itself is really actually pretty nice. There were just a few trip-ups, ""quirks"" and other abnormalities that left a bad taste in my mouth at Cork (and it wasn't from the wine!). 

The restaurant and bar itself are divided into three areas - There's the front dining room with the bar and host station, a middle area that's on a mezzanine and a rear dining room that is quieter but deals with the bustle of the kitchen. There's a tasteful exposed brick, tin ceiling, concrete floor theme going that is well-executed and the lighting is soft enough to make the whole thing seem intimate. 

I went with a friend recently and we really enjoyed the food and wine - We each had a glass of red, a glass of white and a glass of a dessert rose and we shared the avocado toast, duck confit and scallops. The prices are a bit high for what you get, but everything is at least presented nicely - Our only quandary was with the fact that for $11, you get two scallops. Well, at least we got to taste them. Either way, the food is actually well-prepared and thoughtfully executed. The wine list is extensive which helps, although the prices (in my opinion) are beyond ridiculous for this area of Washington, D.C. My favorite Côtes du Rhône costs $12 per bottle, so why should it be $12 per glass in this, Washington D.C.'s most beloved ""up-and-coming"" neighborhood? This isn't Georgetown, dear. 

As I mentioned, there were a few things that really did not rub me the right way here. Their reservation rules are bizarre and absolutely unnecessary as far as I'm concerned - Something like you can call 45 minutes in advance to get your name on a list, but not make a reservation. My friend and I ended up waiting about 30 minutes for table to open up (ample time to buy some egregiously overpriced Côtes du Rhône from the bar) and were finally seated at what may have been the worst table in the house - The one right by the kitchen door and next to a window looking into the kitchen which bathed our table in lovely fluorescent light. The waitress, while feigning pleasantness, was transparently uninterested in anything but setting forth the absolute pretense which has probably seeped into her brain by now and kindly reminded us that they have ""Old World"" wines only... Meaning, only European wines so forget your favorite Sonoma vintner, for he is not good enough for Columbia Heights. 

The crowd was robust and mostly middle aged, but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. For what it is, I'd say I will look forward to going back to Cork to have some wine and a small amuse-bouche, although I don't know if it'll really be a destination again.

Our server was friendly, knowledgeable about wine and efficient.  She checked up on us occasionally during our meal, but wasn't intrusive.

The atmosphere is good.  Nice, but not too nice, and laid back.  It wasn't pretentious, which isn't easy for a wine bar in DC.

The wine was good.  My wife and I tried Spanish, French, and Italian reds, and each was very good.

I didn't rate Cork higher because the food was average, overall.  The three-cheese plate was good (we had the ""cow"" selection, as opposed to sheep or goat), but not spectacular.  We then moved on to the tapas.  First came the calamari and rock shrimp.  The menu made the dish sound like it was going to be unique - a new take on calamari.  Instead, we ended up with a mediocre plate of calamari that we could've gotten at some chain restaurant in any strip in the US.  There were, at most, three pieces of shrimp.  Yep, just a big plate of TGIFriday's-esque fried calamari.

Next came the pork shank.  This was the best of the plates.  The pork was tender, the sauce was tasty, although not spectacular, and the grits-like substance was flavorful (can't remember what it was).

Finally, the server brought us the exotic mushrooms.  The mushrooms were solid, but nothing unique.  Although I liked the taste, I felt like I was served a side of mushrooms that somebody would put on a steak.  I just wish they'd done something more inventive.

They also said the middle section was reserved (FYI -reservations only bewteen 530-630). But when we left we saw groups of two people seated in the front area and were a little miffed.

We had the three cheese sampler came with bread with fruit in it which was a tasty pairing,;the eggplant dish which I assumed would be grilled patties, but it was chopped up eggplant salsa which I did not like; the prosciutto panini was excellent and we should have ordered two; the sunchokes were also good;and the tialpia was okay although the portions were just four small pieces.

solution: head to cork.

it felt heretical to sit down at cork and ask the waitress for cocktails, but she happily offered that their bartender could mix something up if we'd only give her a favorite alcohol. me: gin. kevin's initial benedictine request came up short, but his second request stuck (and i cannot recall what it was. rye? bourbon? whiskey? one of those.). shortly thereafter we were served two cocktails in cork's usual water glasses - easily double the size of a martini glass. filled with alcohol. perfect.

my cocktail was a mix of gin and allspice dram with a little cherry heering and simple syrup (there might have been one other ingredient that escapes me now). i'm a fan of allspice liqueur and the drink was a perfect hello to fall - almost cider-like in taste. 

while the kitchen is open tables are requested to order food, a request we didn't have aproblem complying with. skipping over the cheese and cold plates, we settled on oven roasted roma tomatoes and french fries on the hot plate menu. it's an almost-given that if there are fries we will order them. the tomatoes came out skinned on toasted bread, topped with a generous goat cheese crumble and tasted perfect. they were easy to bite into (i'm always bummed when a tomato dish comes out and you bite into it and end up with the whole tomato slice in your mouth and half a piece of toast leftover) and the goat cheese complimented the tomato well. i was less excited about the fries - well-executed crisp-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside and sprinkled with sea salt and lemon - but was underwhelmed by the ketchup with cumin and other spices. kevin likened the ketchup to cocktail sauce and i was actually surprised when he didn't end up taking home the remainder, but we both agreed that a fry cooked in duckfat is superior in a cocktail semi-upscale setting.

As a result, we had to wait awhile to get in our order or food delivered.  The cocktails I had were delicious and had a nice little kick.  The duck egg roll was tasty and crisp.

When Slate opened, it was a true gem with wonderful dishes and small plates and fantastic desserts (I still dream about the southern rum cake).  But in the last year I have had more then one disappointing meal.  Most recently I dropped in for a burger (not grassfed beef but still $14 or $18 with cheese and bacon).  I ordered it cooked medium but it came out very well done and even burnt and crispy on the outside.  The bartender never noticed when he placed the obviously charred burger in front of me.  Nor did he ever ask how it was or if it was cooked correctly while I was eating..   And I was one of 3 people at the bar and in the restaurant as a whole.

I think Slate is either resting on its laurels of its first year or more focused on wine and beer sales than it's cuisine. They need a consistent kitchen staff.

I went with my family and ordered the fish tacos and asked for the chipotle aioli to be put on the side because I don't like spicy. Unfortunately for me there were dozens of tiny pieces of jalapeños included in the taco filing which made the dish impossible for me to eat without having at least ten glasses of water between each bite. However if you can handle spicy I'm sure the fish tacos would be delicious it just wasn't my cup of tea. I did taste what everyone else ordered and of everything I ate the duck egg rolls were my favorite. The presentation was clean and it tasted absolutely delicious. The steak sandwich was also quite good served on crisp brioche with caramelized onions and gruyere cheese. The quality of the meat was not the best but the caramelized onions were cooked perfectly and made the dish a success. 

When we had asked for a desert menu the waiter came back and said that the kitchen could not prepare any of the deserts listed on the menu and offered us tarts with key lime creme topped with fruit and dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon. The presentation was understated but meticulous, it was obvious that the chef had taken his/her time delicately placing each strawberry in just the right spot. The tart was absolutely scrumptious, the fruits was very fresh and the key lime creme was airy and had just the right mixture of sweet and tangy.

We made reservations for a Wednesday evening, but once we arrived I realized that we could have walked right in and been seated. The bar are is very cute-stylish in a modern, industrial way. The dining area didn't quite match that area and I didn't like the white table cloths because they didn't seem to fit. 

Our waiter was very nice and attended to us right away. Since it was incredibly warm outside my girlfriend chose to have a beer and I ordered a glass of pinot noir. To eat we shared the wild mushroom bruchetta, the ahi tuna poke and the pan roasted shrimp. Our drinks were brought over right away and I wasn't happy to receive a cold glass of red wine- despite the heat I wanted a glass of red served at room temperature. I decided to try it out anyways and decided I didn't love it thus I asked the waiter if I could have a different type of red wine that isn't served cold. Our waiter explained that all of the glasses are chilled and the only way to have a unchilled glass is to order a whole bottle- that's a lot of wine for just one so left without any options I stuck with my cold red wine and tried to enjoy it.  A cold pinot makes sense to me, but a cold glass of syrah just seems weird. Anyways, I evenutally got over the cold wine thing.

Our mushroom bruchetta was pretty good, but the bread could have been better- I think a French baguette would have been a better chose than the large slices of French bread. Our ahi tuna poke was also good, the chips served alongside were interesting- not bad, but not great either.

Big plus is the wine list. They have a pretty good selection with descent prices. I started with a glass of Pinot Noirs then changed to a Chianti. Both were great. 

The food is just OK! Their hummus plate was my favorite, which was surrounded with roasted veggies, in case you didn't want to load on carbs (pita bread.)
We also had the Paella with shrimp, which was just ok. Nothing to rave about and I probably wouldn't get it again. It was just soggy rice with peas and 2 pieces of shrimp on top. 
The goat cheese salad was just ok too. It was just plain spinach with red onions and goat cheese. I think their chef can be a little more creative than this! Add more pine nuts maybe?? Perhaps some caramalized onions? Something!!

As far as ambiance, for a wine bar, I think the place should be a tad darker with their lighting to give off a more romantic cool vibe.  Maybe some cool music? 

Also wasn't a big fan of the bartender. He spent more time organizing his wines than to pay any attention to his customers. I had to ask him for everything twice even though we were eating at the bar.

For starters, it looked like whoever decorated the place actually cared about what they were doing. The interior is aesthetically pleasing, and gives one a sense of fine dining and that the food and experience here will be enjoyable, but still casual enough to dress down and relax. Another plus was the waitress. Her name is Iva, and she was awesome to talk to. She was very helpful, and open to conversation outside of the menu. Also, the food was impressively good. I ordered the Roasted Cauliflower for the main course, and the hummus spread to share with others. The beer selection was solid, and featured a few brews that I hadn't heard of, which was nice. 

All that aside, however, I wasn't really blow away. The whole experience still strikes me as average. The portion sizes were smaller than I'd expected, and I didn't feel quite satisfied by the time I put my fork down. Luckily, this is modestly balanced out by the inexpensive price tag associated with most of the meals. Normally I don't notice or care about occupancy levels in a restaurant, but this one was noticeably bare. There was only one other group of people when I arrived, and they left shortly after we got there. It was almost as if it were expected, too. Iva was the only person on staff that was visible. Perhaps it was because the place was so spacious and well decorated, but the vacancy makes one think if this place isn't all that great. Then again, maybe we just came at a lull period, or some other factors were at play that evening.

I loved the ambience and decor. The energy was really effervescent. The food and service however are dismally below the expectations set from the outside looking in. 

I walked in and was not greeted at all despite two team members right at the door. After standing there looking at them and they me, I spoke first and asked to be seated at a table since the bar was full.  

I ordered the Ribeye which was served raw, not rare, raw. No. It isn't supposed to be tartare. I asked to have the ribeye cooked more and I was told that normal people's raw was their medium. My steak came back much better. This time it was well done (again not what I asked for) however, except for super saltiness it was actually very good. Additionally I know the difference between ribeye and skirt steak and it looked like skirt steak.  

I also ordered prawns. One of the prawns was so over cooked that the shell didn't want to come off. You're served two and the other one was so mushy I just gave up. The sauce was bland and not memorable. The green onion slices were dry and stale. AVOID THIS DISH AT ALL COSTS!

Lastly I got the cucumbers. That was the best of all. I highly recommend them! 

I had some other issues and I spoke with the manager who was very accommodating. I told him about my other issues that I won't mention here but I didn't share my experience with the food.

--migas was a nice mix of fried bread chunks with blood sausage, some kind of tasty sauce and a fried egg - nice portion and very flavorful - the only one we liked;
--serrano ham sandwich was a disappointment as it was basically a white bread sandwich with barely-there slice of ham, fried egg and piece of roasted pepper. Flavor was blah.
--benedict was a piece of crusty bread with bacon or ham pieces covered with a poached egg and an interesting-looking dark orange sauce that had zero flavor. I am guessing it was a version of hollandaise but it really had no zip or lemony profile. Another disappointment.
--we had a 4th dish that was basically a pile of fresh-cut/fresh-fried potato chips with salt and vinegar flavor with a pile of scrambled eggs on top. Despite nice textures and depth of flavor, with so many other bland egg dishes it was also a miss

We were impressed with the interior of the restaurant. Nicely designed, with a comfy feeling, everything very clean. We were seated at the ""bar tables"". Actual tables with stools next to the bar. The place was full but not overcrowded. I found it very pleasant that the music was really only audible in the background. Also, they have no TVs there which I personally like very much. 

Our soups came out not too quickly. We had already eaten ourselves trough the complimentary bread basket. They were good and very hot, though and since we had the bread that was ok.

Then, the issues started and we still have not idea what was going on. We had ordered five tapas dishes, all of them easy stuff, nothing fancy. When we had finished the soup, we were waiting for the waiter to come back, clear our plates and for the tapas to arrive. However, the waiter never came back. We were wondering if his shift was over or something since we didn't even see him anymore. After 30 minutes, I spotted and grabbed him. That's when he realized we had been sitting there without the food coming out. He was apologetic of course, ran to the kitchen and promptly, three of the five tapas dishes came out. Since tapas are tiny, obviously, and we were hungry, we were finished within 10 minutes of arrival. Again, nothing happened for a little while. Then, forth dish came out. After we had finished that - a looong nothing. In the meantime, I was starting to feel very uncomfortable on that bar stool. I was 37 weeks pregnant at the time and we had been sitting there for about 1.5 hours. 

I asked the waiter for the check. The manager had checked with us before and he was aware of the issue and offered to take like half of the balance off the check. That was nice and and we appreciated it. The kitchen was blamed for the problem. However, that seems highly unlikely since all the people around us, even those who ordered later than us, had received their food. Also, as I mentioned before, our dishes were so easy that there was really not much for the kitchen to do. And when we said that there was still food missing, it came out right away. So, I doubt that the kitchen staff was at fault here...

Anyway, when the check came, I told the waiter that there was still one dish missing. He was very surprised and clearly embarrassed, ran towards the kitchen again and the food was served within 1 minute...

He was very sweet and gave us vouchers for one tapas each when he brought the check.

So overall: Nice location, nice staff, however, food is just ok. It's nothing special really. And that is what really threw me off in the end. I was in that bar for 2 hours, waiting for some super ordinary dishes to come out that I could have EASILY cooked for myself at home in half of the time. It is just bar food really.

1. The service -- SO nice and accommodating. 

2. The atmosphere -- very comfortable and inviting.

Where I wasn't as delighted was with the food. The red pepper spread and hummus were EXCELLENT. The meats came out and got cold pretty quickly, which made them a bit tougher. I also wish there had been more sauce(s) -- one came with a kind of tzatziki on the side, that was more yogurt without any kind of herb in it, so not particularly flavorful. So the meat dishes were kind of dry and tough.

A TIP: You don't need as many dishes as they suggest -- we had a few appetizers and shared one or two main dishes, and that was more than enough. I think the recommendation to us was four small dishes each -- I really think that would've been too much. You can always order more!

All of their interesting wines have to be purchased by the bottle (and at 50 bucks a pop, are certainly not worth it), and the ones by the glass can easily be purchased at any liquor store for 5-8 bucks. For that, I think they should stop calling themselves a wine bar. Psh.

The food was ok (not outstanding, just ok). The single best dish of the night was the Sebze Begendi (sauteed mushrooms, onions with zucchini, roasted red peppers on top of an eggplany/gruyere puree.), which was heavenly. 

Overall, their prices are a little steep and their portions are kind of small. Small plates for 4 of us (and we only got about 8 things in total) without wine was almost 120 bucks. I found that to be a bit egregious.

The bad news is that I am not a huge fan of Turkish food, and this place didn't do much to change my opinion.

Turkey was my favorite country on my last vacation, but it's food did not have the same freshness as other Mediterrean countries. My fiance and I ordered 5 small plates to share, most of which were recommended by our friendly waiter. Nothing was bad, but nothing was great either. Breaking it down:

-The Muhammara (roasted red pepper spread) and Hünkar Begendi (braised beef served on an eggplant puree with gruyere cheese) were both fine but I preferred the versions at Zaytinya better. The spread, in particular, seemed more processed here so you couldn't really taste the red pepper.
-The Arnavut Cigeri (pan-fried spicy calf's liver served with onions and parsley) seemed overdone and a little overspiced.
-The Manti (turkish-style homemade mini beef stuffed dough served in a garlic yogurt and topped with a buttered red pepper sauce) were completely different from what I expected. Essentially little raviolis swimming in a yogurt sauce that was overpowering.
-Some kind of Spicy Lamb Stew Special - this was pretty good.

I wish I liked the food better because the service was exceptionally friendly and the atmosphere is cozy and nice. 

But in the words of Tim Gunn,  Chacun à son goût - It's a matter of taste. You might like this place if you're into Turkish food, but I think I'll head to Zaytinya (a turkish/lebanese/greek hybrid) next time.

Food: Turkey has some of the best wood burning oven baked bread known to man.  The bread's got to be piping hot, straight out of the oven, a perfect, soft-yet-chewy fodder for the variety of delicious dips and appetizers.  Their bread is good but, again, not great.

Now, to be fair, we did order our mezze to go so we didn't experience the wait service.  (With the exception of the woman who took our order, who was extremely friendly.)  We had the Babaganouj, the Zucchini pancakes and the feta cigars.

The food was quite tasty.  My friend and I both enjoyed the feta cigars the most out of the three.  However, we were really annoyed with the tiny amount of food we got for the price.  Now, I realize that these are mezze and not supposed to feed an army, but honestly, we got about two tablespoons of Babaganouj in our container.  And the feta cigars were tiny - 4 of them - only really one bite each.  Now, perhaps the quantity problem was because they're just open and weren't sure how to deal with a carryout order, but seriously, 4 dips of bread and the Babaganouj was gone.  $16 plus tax for those three items!

Overall, the atmosphere was cute, although I agree that the dropped ceiling did not fit the ambiance they are trying to convey.   I had to remove my coat myself, no one held my chair, and I had to request that the server hang up my coat after he watched me struggle to find a place to stash it.  That's fine for an inexpensive place, but not for somewhere that costs well over $100 for two people who only have 1 glass of wine each.  They were great at clearing the table and promptly removing crumbs after each set of tapas, which was surprising after how inattentive they were during seating.  Also, I was a bit bummed when I noticed that the reservation (which was made in my name) was under a similar sounding men's name... I had even spelled my name for them when I called.  Get with the times, gents, or at least place the screen where I can't see it so clearly!

Aside from that, we felt welcome and enjoyed the meal overall, although there were weak spots on the menu.  The third course entrees (see below) were terribly bland and my partner found the textures ""squishy"" and ""kind of gross"", especially since there was little flavor to give the soft textures a purpose.  The wine selection was delightful.  My experience with Turkish food is pretty limited (1 other restaurant), but I have enjoyed what I've tried in the past. 

Let me repeat this in case it didn't stand out enough in the other reviews: portions are TINY!  This was true of our prix fixe, but also of the plates going by to other tables.

The break down by vegetarian/vegan dishes (all were vegan, just leaving breadcrumbs for those searching for vegetarian, too):

Mercimek Çorbasi (lentil soup) - Absolutely delicious!  Use the lemon wedge provided, it makes all the difference.  Good for eating with the spoon and with the provided bread that is abundantly served throughout meals.  Served heated.

Mercimek Köfte (lentil cake) - tiny, but very tasty. Served at room temp.

Dolma (stuffed grape leaves) - tiny, delicious with just the right amount of tang, and soft, easily eaten grape leaves around the stuffing. Served at room temp.

Muhammara (red pepper spread) - absolutely delicious! This was our favorite dish of the night, aside from desert.  Smooth, flavorful, visually appealing, just a little spicy, and very nom-able. Served cool.

Patlcan Ezme (grilled eggplant, onions, oil and lemon) - Finely chopped enough to be a chunky spread, but not described as such.  The textures were good but it was rather bland, even with lemon juice. Served warm.

Imam Bayildi (stuffed baked eggplant) - Small eggplant cooked until very tender, filled with something resembling the Patlican Ezme (see above).  I was thrilled that the egg plant was very tender, then saddened that it had no flavor. Served warm.

Enginar (boiled artichoke, garnished with carrots, peas, rosemary) - Very soft and squishy, I was surprised it was even able to hold its shape on the plate.  The presentation was nice, but this one had the texture that made it hard to eat for my partner.  It had a little more flavor than the stuffed eggplant, but was still pretty darned bland and disappointing. Served warm.

Taze Fasulye (diced green beans with tomato, onion) - Flavorful and tasty.  This came with the above two and was the only thing worth eating on the plate.  Served a little cool.

Armut Tatlisi (poached pair, lemon sorbet, crushed nuts, dusted in powdered sugar) - Absolutely delightful and stunning.  Beautifully presented, flavors were perfect together, couldn't have been better.  

Wine: Only 1 Riesling was available by the glass, out of 3 on the list. I forgot the name but it was tasty, served nicely, and at the appropriate coolness.

Bread was beautifully presented.  The taste didn't stand out but wasn't bad either.

I would return for appetizers and desert with wine, but it's not worth another visit for the main meal.  

Bathrooms and accessibility:

Two restrooms - both are 1 seaters, unisex and clean. 

The restaurant is at street level and has a small thresh hold bump, but I believe that most folks on wheels could make it through easily enough.  The ramp to the dining area is narrow with a sharp turn, so wider wheels may not work.  For those with mobility concerns: I would suggest asking for a table near the entrance, as the space between was fine for walking but would be a squeeze for wider wheelchairs and anyone on crutches.  Some chairs have sturdy arms, many do not.  Once in, the place is small and restrooms are accessible, though they're in the back so you have to get past some tables.  Bars and other transitioning aids were sparse in the restroom I visited, but it was pretty roomy.  Sink was an elevated bowl, so hard to reach if you ride low.

4716,Ezme Restaurant & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=ZEXSjo-woD1AeT0HAlNHZQ,"We decided to go to Ezme on a whim and my husband and I both liked that vegan items were labeled on their menu. The interior of the restaurant is simple and cute. The space is cozy yet pretty quiet early in the evening. Our waiter was helpful in explaining the Turkish (version of) tapas concept to us and he was very attentive & knowledgeable, though overly pushy. 

I ordered Mercimek Corbasi (red lentil soup), the Ispanak Salatasi (spinach salad with berries), and the Mercimek Kofte (lentil & bulgur cakes). The soup was the highlight of my meal, exquisitely flavored... and as intense as a double rainbow. The spinach salad was comprised of lots of spinach (maybe a little too much), with way too few berries and a delicate olive oil pomegranate dressing. Presentation was excellent. The lentil & bulgur cakes were tasty, but served cold - which was actually fine, just unexpected and a bit of a shock to my eager taste buds at the time. My husband ordered the same soup, the Dolma (stuffed grape leaves) and the Sebze Kabab (veggie kebab). He agreed about the soup, the grape leaves were the best he's had but admittedly he is not a big fan of grape leaves, and the veggie kebab was a bit undercooked but otherwise good (think- raw onion). My parents ordered some dead animals, I won't comment on those. It is, however, a good place to take both the veg & omnivorous. 

Overall, the food was good. I would even say it was memorable. Was it worth $150 for four people (nearly $40 a person)? I really don't think so. With so many restaurants in the city, and in Dupont alone, I'd have to recommend dining elsewhere.

They had the option of ordering off their regular menu or from their tasting menu, and it was nice to have that choice. The spreads and bread were delicious appetizers and their wine selection was great. I had a Turkish wine that was the perfect compliment to dinner. The entrees were really tasty, but we definitely could have eaten more and ended up each getting a dessert (which were great). This is definitely a place to get several items each and share, b/c the portions are small. Probably the best part of the experience was the wait staff. Our server was attentive, nice, and very helpful. She was pleasant, offered suggestions, and described some of the authentic dishes. The two negatives about Ezme were the portion sizes and the parking situation. The plates were really small and some were difficult to share. For example, the salmon kebob came as two tiny skewers of salmon, which is hard to share with 3 people and was only enough for a taste. On the same note, we felt the prices were a bit high for the portion sizes. Also, parking was a nightmare. The restaurants next door offer vallet but Ezme did not. We had to bribe the vallet guys to park our car for a hefty tip, which worked out okay except when we got to our car it was parked in an illegal stop and was unlocked.

One thing to be aware of that if you book and are interested in the band you must tell them you want a seat upstairs. Otherwise when you show up they may sit you downstairs.  I don't know ho to make this better but the reservation system is not clear and there have been situations - nuff said.

The other problem for me is that there is only one salmon dish that I can eat on their menu, given I don't eat meat and I am gluten free.  The salmon is fine but nothing super special.   Fortunately we only go every few months.  Otherwise this would get old fast.

The Restaurant Week menu in January was pretty decent, in terms of options. I had the salmon hash brown dish that other Yelpers seem to have taken issue with. Perhaps I just have a nostalgia for McDonald's hash browns that I've suppressed, but I really liked the dish, and have been daydreaming about it ever since. The potato crust was salty and flaky, and the salmon inside was tender and flavorful. It also came with some sort of fruit reduction that complemented the flavors nicely. No complaints from me. 

I've also heard complaints about the creme brulee, but I didn't have a problem with it. The texture wasn't as smooth and creamy as other creme brulees, but it was tasty nonetheless.

We sat upstairs in the Wine Bar, and although the lounge type chairs were a little difficult to eat from, the ambiance was nice.  Before ordering we were offered wine from an ongoing wine tasting.  

I started with a pureed mushroom soup that was very good.  It was very earthy, but with a nice hint of sherry to round it out.  I think I enjoyed the most the small pieces of mushroom that were super concentrated with sherry.  Next we shared a seared foie gras an escargot risotto.  The risotto was light and creamy which paired well with the strong flavor of the snails.  The foie gras was a relatively large piece that was heavily seared on the outside.  While the outside parts were delicious, the inside was actually very bland.  The foie gras was paired with caramelized mangos which packed a super intense sweet/sour punch and may have been the best part of the appetizer.  For an entree I had a cassoulet that was very rich with a good variety of different meats but also very filling.  To finish we shared a fruit tart of kiwi and grape, which I thought was a nice combination.  

Overall I thought the food was very good.  Classic french dishes updated just a little bit.  The thing that stuck with me was the intensity of flavor from each dish.

I am giving Bistrot Lepic 3 instead of 4 stars because in my leftover container I found a piece of metal that looked kind of like a twisted up wire.  I don't know if it was in my entree while I was eating it or somehow got mixed in when the food was put into a to-go box.  In any case it was a very serious choking hazard and put me off from finishing the leftovers.

Let me explain.
I called Bistrot Lepic several days prior to going there to enjoy the company of my date and celebrate the 17th of Nov ""Beaujolais Nouveau Day"".
I wanted to know if I needed a reservation for that evening. 
When I called I was informed that I did not need a reservation but to be sure to get there before 6:30.
I arrived at the wine bar at 6:10 ahead of my date went upstairs and was promptly told by the maître d that I needed a reservation.
Frustrated by the fact that I had called well in advance for that very purpose. To be told there was no need and now to be told otherwise. Really, I mean REALLY !!!
When lack of communication among the staff is evident at the front door one becomes worried especially when your special someone is in traffic on the way to meet you after a long day at work.
Finally a gentleman came from behind the maître d listened to what I had to say and took care of me.  You could tell the maître d had no intention of taking care of the customer. Which was sad for such a nice place.

I was seated and the bartender really aided me in relaxing and having the right wine waiting when my date arrived.
We had a wonderful evening thanks to the bartender, the music, and the wine bars warm décor is very nice.
