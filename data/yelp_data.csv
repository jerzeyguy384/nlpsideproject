I thought they gave me the happy hour portion, but no I'd hate to see how small that portion is. I was expecting a creamy cheesy sauce, no the gnocchi came in a brown broth that only had a hint of blue cheese flavor. The mushrooms were few and far between. The dish had a lot of potential with all the flavors, but it was just too boring/plain.

That being said, I was not let down, being a sucker for how atmosphere adds to the overall experience of a restaurant/bar, this place did not disappoint. This is a neighbourhood wine bar that explores wines from all over the world, think places like ""World of Beer"" except with wine. It's a great place to get what it's name says; flights, and to explore lesser known wines you may not have tried from various regions. The wine menu is extensive and you can get them either by the glass or pick from various pre made flights broken down by their types and where they came from. I've tried many from the few times I've been here and have not been disappointed. They also have a small food menu ranging with item small bites items to dinner entrees and I although I have not eaten the dinner I did snag a few smaller items (get the Italian meatballs, trust me). 

Flight Wine Bar can be perfect for almost any occasion; dinner, happy hour, date night, etc. It was never too busy the few times I went and the staff is great!

Flight wine bar was exactly what we were looking for!

This gem is a triple threat: great wine, great food, and great ambiance!

The wine menu is impressive (size, variety, price range), and I loved having the ability to try a variety of wines.  I really loved the wine flights and think they would be enjoyed both by the wine enthusiast as well as a newbie that doesn't know what to order.

The food was so much fun!  I am a sucker for a good cheese plate and this place offers two varieties!!!  Savory AND sweet!  Oh, how sweet it was.  Definitely get the cheese plate.  The chocolate one was my favorite.  And the wild mushrooms!  Get those too!

The ambiance was a treat.  You can tell that a lot of thought went into the design and decor of Flight Win Bar.  When my husband and I walked in the door we immediately felt like we were on date night, rather than needing our normal glass of wine just to relax.

Being one of a kind in Chinatown also gives it the upper hand when it comes to the bar selection in that neighborhood. The decor is trendy and I loved the bottle display at the bar. 

Here's where flight fell short for me. I LOVE wine. LOVE it. I'm not a connoisseur by any means but I know what I like and know what service at a wine bar should be. Ours was definitely lacking. We weren't sure who our server actually was which would have been fine had we not needed to practically tackle a server to take our order or refill waters. 

The appetizers are definitely over priced but at $7 a glass for happy hour wines, it kind of evens out. Kind of. When you have a $16 cheese plate on your menu that could generously be described as sparse, the least you could do is serve my wine to me in stemware and not some hipster rocks glass. 

Flight has so much potential but I'd rather pay $9/glass elsewhere for better pours served alongside better food.

I had the Croatian/Macedonian wine flight, which was interesting and different from more classic choices - I appreciate a little adventure.
However, the food was a bit of a letdown-- a 16 dollar cheese plate should have a reasonable amount of cheese and bread/crackers on it, enough for 2 people to niblle from, or? Well, ours didn't - with 3 small crackers, there wasn't much option but to eat the cheese by itself.

I would say the best part of this place is the atmosphere and the server. Whoever our server was was extremely knowledgeable about wines and really impressed me. I think this place is really a place to try new wines and to really understand, which wine you have been missing.

13,13.0,,2015-01-15,"Washington, DC",Flight Wine Bar,"Flight is very easy to miss amid the hustle and bustle of the busy Chinatown area. It's a non-descript storefront restaurant located right next to Corner Bistro. Inside, it's a chic but cozy atmosphere; perfect for a first date or an evening with friends. 

I came for a wine tasting with my alumni group. All of the staff were so welcoming and went out of their way to accommodate us. I arrived very late because there was a Caps game going on and parking was almost non-existent. By the time I arrived, most of the food was gone but one of the staff members (I did not catch her name, but she was a tall, thin white woman, about 30 or so, with dark hair and a very pleasant demeanor) explained to me that they were in the middle of dinner service, but that she would go to the kitchen and see what she could bring for me. She came back several times with sweets and treats for me, and made sure that I didn't feel left out of the festivities. This was not required of her by any means (not to mention the restaurant was pretty busy) and I was really appreciative of her phenomenal service.

I love wine, but the bottles are only part of the allure. The food is delicious. The zucchini fritters are to DIE for... and I'm not even a vegetarian. I could eat at least a dozen of those things. Amazing. I also had some kind of chocolate truffle ball that was absolutely divine paired with a Syrah blend. I missed the charcuterie and the duck sliders, but I was told that they were both amazing. I would definitely come back on my own. There was an Austrian white wine that we sampled that I think warrants further, more in-depth ""research"".

On the plus side, Flight offers an extensive selection of ""flight"" groupings or you can order by the glass or bottle.  It was rather hot outside therefore typically on a hot summer day a cold refreshing white does the trick.  I chose wines from Greece, France, Germany, and Italy and Robert, who was our waiter, was on point when he suggested I order the ""Aromatic Yet Dry Whites"" which included 1 flight from California as well.  On the downside the menu left a lot to be desired.  It literally took me about a half an hour or more to decide what I wanted to eat.  Needless to say, I opted for the Grilled Octopus which was edible; however, I wouldn't order it again.

We were able to get some of the few remaining bar seats and right away a bartender brought over water and menus for us to look at. The flight list has so many great and interesting options that it was hard to choose! We must have spent a solid fifteen minutes just reading through all the options and descriptions. I believe my friend ordered the New World Whites, and I chose the Star Spangled Banner collection of domestic wines. The Viognier was fruity but not too sweet, the Pinot Noir was so smooth and the Syrah blend was bold! I really enjoyed the wide range they managed to fit into three glasses. And I appreciated the little cards detailing the specifics of each wine so we didn't have to keep going back to the menu. 
We also ordered a couple selections of the charcuterie. The prosciutto, another meat and the Caciocavallo cheese, which literally translates to Cheese Horse, so, how could we not choose that one, you know?
We ended up not eating here because it seemed pretty pricey. But other than that, the only minus I would give flight is that I think it's weird to serve the wine in those bodega glasses. I don't really know why I feel that way, it's just not my favorite.

This was a nice and fun environment. We decided not to order food here because we looked at some of the small plates and appetizers they had to offer, and nothing really stood out.

So they might want to reconsider that one. Honestly I think the menu needs a revision overall, I mean they removed charcuterie and cheese plate from the menu, which is a staple of pretty much any wine bar.

We shared two different wine flights, and our server told us all about each wine in extreme detail. The level of information she had made the experience feel all the more fancy.

The plates are all quite small, but the flavors were huge! We shared the charcuterie plate, the pappardelle, and the octopus. The charcuterie and cheese plate was on the small side for the price, but the meats were tasty. I looooved the octopus, it had just the right amount of give when you bite into it, not rubbery at all.

It is a wine bar, so let's start there. 2/3 of the flight of ""Not your Grandmother's Chardonnay"" was delicious. I love unoaked Burgundy chardonnays so the first on the list was wonderful. To my surprise, the unoaked from Virginia was also great. Now to find it in PA.

The server Sara was sweet and helpful. All smiles and went through the entire menu to find all of the vegetarian options for my wife.

We arrived on a chilly Friday evening and were warmly greeted by Fiona our bartender. She took care of us explaining the drink menu in detail and helped us choose some great flights. When our wine arrived she took the time to explain each glass (9 glasses between the three of us) and told us it's origin and so forth. 

We ordered the Virginia flight, the sauvignon blanc flight and the Spanish reds flight. As a huge fan of sauvignon blanc, I wasn't a huge fan of this flight as all of the wines were infused with other things - not just sauvignon blanc.

The clear winner of the night was definitely my roommate's spanish reds flight. She was obsessed and I definitely look forward to trying that one out next time!

Their rustic decor creates a nice and warm atmosphere that literally invites you to hang out there for a longer period of time.

We were able to snatch a long table on the right side and decided to order a few dishes to share since everyone was hungry.

Here is what we decided to get:
- Warm Spiced Olives 
- Tagliolini Con Tartufo
- Mushroom Toast
- Cheese & Charcuterie board for 5 with smoked speck, salami cured with fennel and Sangiovese, prosciutto, Beemster gouda and Bayley Hazen blue cheese

All food options were great, but my favorites were the pasta and the blue cheese.

For wines, we had a hard time deciding since their wine menu is massive.
Eventually, we paired together in 2s and each pair ordered a couple of flights. 
My girl and I went with the ""Old World Whites"" and the ""Balkan Reds"".
All wines were lovely, but I think I enjoyed the whites a bit more than the reds.

All in all, I had a lovely experience here and I can't wait to come back during my next visit to D.C.

Excellent atmosphere, attentive and prompt service and most importantly yummy food!

My two friends and I showed up for happy hour. The happy hour menu was surprisingly lush. There were several food options as well as beer and wine offered. I can't remember if there were any mixed drink option, I have selective attention to beer and wine only. 

The prices for happy hour were very reasonable. Browsing the normal menu, I don't know that I would visit, just due to my very limited budget and frugality habits. The happy hour was very pleasing though. I had the butternug squash fritters, which were a little mushy on the inside (as expected) and crispy and well seasoned on the outside (yummerz for sure). I also sampled the meatball happy hour plate which came with two decently sized meatballs, doused in sauce with a hefty garlic bread portion on the side. Veryyyy delish. The meatballs were moist and seasoned well. Cooked to perfection. 

I would go back again when I'm in town, for the happy hour menu for sure!

Layout/Decor - 3 stars

Downtown DC needs more wine bars.  Don't get me wrong, I love Proof, but the bill can really add up sometimes, so it's nice to have a good, less expensive option nearby  Having said that, Flight is sort of an odd space; the curved bar with seats for 16 is interesting, with what appears to be a tree growing behind it, but the rest of it is a bit drab.   

But you're not really here for that are you?  You're here for the wine, and I'm here to tell you that it's worth the visit for their thoughtful and interesting selection.  Bored of Bordeaux?  Tired of Tempranillo?  Flight has unusual, inexpensive, and often overlooked grape varietals such a Serbian Prokupac, Hungarian Kekfrankos, and Georgian Rkatsiteli.  And since this is Flight, they of course serve flights of wine with choices such as the Ottoman Empire (whites from Greece, Slovenia, and Georgia) and Austro-Hungarian Empire (a mix of white and rosés from the aforementioned countries).  

The glassware is short and boxy, and pours are available in half and full pours.  No cocktails, but they offer liquor and four draft beers with another nine beers and ciders in bottles and cans, including Stillwater Stateside Saison and Evolution Lucky No. 7 Porter.  The food menu is short and skews Italian (charcuterie, cheese, and sausage for apps, and linguine with sardines and wild boar oso buco for mains).
