Anastasia and Dave are friendly people with great taste, and they have created wonderful, unpretentious wine bar. The wine list is delicious - we have our favorites like everyone but have never had a bad wine from their list - and the staff give great advice if you're not sure. Anastasia even gave us recommendations about which wineries to hit up in her native land on our summer vacation.

The food is yummy too, if you're okay with the dishes being a bit on the small side for the price.

Overall, this place has us coming back on the regular. The only downside is they've been so successful that it's rarer to see Anastasia and Dave hanging around these days, but that just means they've been doing well. 

A must-try if you live in the U Street/Shaw/Mt. Vernon area.

The staff are great. The waiter on Saturday night was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. I ask him about the cognac selection and he lit up. Turns out we both love to sip good whiskey. I asked if they had Armnagac and he recommended two. I had a one oz pour of each. They were both very good. If your in this neighborhood stop in at La Jambe.

ATMOSPHERE: Went here with a group of friends for happy hour on a Thursday night. It wasn't too crowded so we were able to get a large table. There's also a long marble bar that you can sit at. Soft lighting, cute tea plates that your grandmother owns, and vases with flowers all over the place. Very cute, would recommend for a date or a girls' night! 

WINE: Four options for happy hour, each were between $5-6. Sparkling, rose, white and red. Very good wines for the price. We tried the Pinot Noir which was delicious. They also have beer if you're not a wine drinker. 

FOOD: We ordered the La Suprise (under Plateaux Mixtes) which is a selection of cheeses and charcuterie that they have for the day. The large size ($51) was enough to feed 6 people. 2 cheeses, 2 meats, blackberry preserve and apricot jam, dried apricots, and 2 bread/water cracker baskets. Had a dried salami and a truffle ham, both of which were delicious. 

SERVICE: Our server was so extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Gave us a run down of the happy hour wines, the cheese and charcuterie.

The space is bright, airy but cozy, beautifully and whimsically decorated, and has a nice outdoor seating area--which is so rare in DC for some reason. The selection of charcuterie, cheeses, wine, and liquor is French-themed, not easy to come by (Comte, anyone?), and just fantastic all around. The cocktails are simply amazing--maybe because they make some of their own bitters among other things. The power-couple owners, Ana and David, are extremely knowledgeable and super nice, and the entirety of their staff is top notch and provide great service.

So next time you find yourself longing for a good aperitif, digestif, or something in between, do yourself a favor and pay this place a visit. You might very well find me there--for better or worse--enjoying a sip of Armagnac or Calvados for a night cap.

He took the difficulty out of ordering a drink by simply asking can he get me tipsy (don't like using the word drunk). Um yeah, why that's not on every bars menu I'm not really sure.

I came here with a girlfriend about 2 weeks ago on a Saturday night around 7:00pm. It wasn't crowded so we sat outside and were lucky enough to be served by Yaz/Yasmani. I can't say enough good things about him! First of all, we saw several wines on the menu that we wanted to try, and when we couldn't make a decision, he offered to put together wine flights for us, even though they weren't listed on the menu. He was so knowledgeable (but humble and unassuming) and friendly that we decided to let him surprise us with the wine selection. I'm a big red wine drinker, and my friend loves champagne, and he prepared customized wine flights to meet our flavor preferences. He nailed it! I've never had a wine flight (that I didn't choose) where I liked all three wines! 

I always love having wine with hummus, but I'm allergic to dairy and my friend and I are both gluten-free, so we didn't want to have the pita bread. Yaz talked to the kitchen and they prepared the nicest plate of fresh, delicately cut veggies to accompany the hummus platter. It was delicious! We also ordered the marcona almonds.

Sometime after 9:00pm, a live band started to play, and it was such a nice way to round out the night. We went to 1301 just looking for a quick glass of wine and some girl chat, and left having made a new friend (the awesome waiter, Yaz) and a new favorite neighborhood bar. Loved it!!

For small plates, these have a good amount of food on them - we had the pear bruschetta, the gambas shrimp and the Spanish quiche,and, combined with the cheese plate (which was not skimpy), we were very satisfied. I am planning to hang out here as much as possible before too many people hear about it and it inevitably gets super-crowded!

Anastasia and Dave are friendly people with great taste, and they have created wonderful, unpretentious wine bar. The wine list is delicious - we have our favorites like everyone but have never had a bad wine from their list - and the staff give great advice if you're not sure. Anastasia even gave us recommendations about which wineries to hit up in her native land on our summer vacation.

The food is yummy too, if you're okay with the dishes being a bit on the small side for the price.

Overall, this place has us coming back on the regular. The only downside is they've been so successful that it's rarer to see Anastasia and Dave hanging around these days, but that just means they've been doing well.

Soft lighting, cute tea plates that your grandmother owns, and vases with flowers all over the place. Very cute, would recommend for a date or a girls' night! 

WINE: Four options for happy hour, each were between $5-6. Sparkling, rose, white and red. Very good wines for the price. We tried the Pinot Noir which was delicious. They also have beer if you're not a wine drinker. 

FOOD: We ordered the La Suprise (under Plateaux Mixtes) which is a selection of cheeses and charcuterie that they have for the day. The large size ($51) was enough to feed 6 people. 2 cheeses, 2 meats, blackberry preserve and apricot jam, dried apricots, and 2 bread/water cracker baskets. Had a dried salami and a truffle ham, both of which were delicious.

More of a wine bar than a restaurant, which was good with me since I'd rather order a bunch of small plates than an entree. Probably not the place for you if you like a big meal.

Posting a new review because they have a new dinner-focused menu and are serving some phenomenal food - high points for me are the pastas (especially the squash gnocchi and wild boar ragu), which are handmade and some of the best rustic Italian in DC. Their seafood dishes are always perfectly cooked. They also have a massive wine list and preselected flights, which gives you the chance to explore wines by the glass from lesser-known winemaking countries.

Not only does it answer the eternal question, ""where do I kill time in Chinatown before the movie/game/etc. that isn't Fudruckers or Lime?"" but it's reasonably quiet, has a fantastic selection of wine (as one would expect), and the best cheese plate I've had in DC. Plus they offer a savory and sweet version, depending on your mood. I have been known to order both. 

Their other food is great too. They have one of the few bread baskets worth paying for, and so far, everything I've ordered has been fresh, creative, and satisfying. 

Flight is also one of the few places in DC where I really prefer sitting at the bar. Not only is it spacious with plenty of elbow room, but the staff is fantastic. My first time there, the bartender introduced me to a new favorite wine after we had a long discussion about the merits of any food or drink that can be described as ""barn yard-y.""

This is a great neighborhood wine bar. It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do. It create an easy atmosphere where people can enjoy different wines in a laid back atmosphere. The new outdoor seating is a big plus too, as there are not a lot of places that have outdoor seating and good food. The staff is knowledgeable and the menu highlights each wines nose, palate and finish.

While the wine is often not on the cheap side (unless you get bottles, where many are very affordable), the food is a good deal. The small plates/apps are mainly under $10 and are a substantial size. Two of them can easily make a meal for most people. The main plates are affordable too. 

This place is a nice, accessible wine bar. I personally find places like proof a little elitist and  stuck up. They may have a more formal atmosphere and tasting process, but that is not what everyone needs. If you are looking for a formal setting or a super rare wine, this may not be the place for you.

I really enjoy the flights (there are 20 or so on the menu) and there's something for everyone, wine novices and aficionados alike. They're a bit on the expensive side at $18, but many of them are pretty unique, and splitting a flight between two people and a glass of wine each makes for decently priced happy hour or pre-dinner drinks. I haven't tried much of the menu, but the cheese plates (I prefer savory #1) and zucchini fritters are quite good.

I was blown away as I walked into the space, after walking across what seemed an airline jetway (very clever), and into a beautiful space with wonderful design and lighting, all adding to an ambience that made me anxious and excited to try some really good food and really good wine.   I've read some of the other reviews here and not sure why everyone seems to be complaining about the staff.  They were extremely efficient and hospitable to our large party, both at the bar and after we got seated.  I started off at the bar where the bartenders asked me about my preferences and quickly came out with a wonderful flight of 3 rosé wine choices.  All were excellent and I was particularly blown away by the Chateu Musar from Lebanon.  The owners frequently checked in with me and when I suggested I had an inkling for a good amber ale, the jolly and informative owner suggested I try the Rea Sea Ale which was, as consistent with my overall experience, also fantastic.  After waiting for my friend who was visiting by way of Hartford, CT., as well as a few of our other friends, we were promptly seated at a table.  

On to the food.  The owners took the liberty of driving the order process after asking us our likes/dislikes. This was a welcome change for me and it speaks to the general positive atmosphere and vibes of this restaurant and its staff.  The starters I tried were all superb.  The cheese plates had an assortment of accoutrements and cheeses that blended perfectly with the wines we were sampling, which were now reds that included the Agrina from Serbia, Hecht & Bannier from France and others all of which were as good if not better than the previous.  I also sampled the squash dolmades, lobster bisque and the glazed lamb chops which all had me thinking: ""more please!!"".  The entrees, while limited in selection, are certainly not limited in taste.  The acorn squash with the chili-lime dressing was wonderful as was the pulled duck with cranberry sauce.  For the dessert I had the tomato soup cake, a nice play on a traditional carrot cake with great texture and taste to finish.

After feeling well satisfied with my meal, the owners returned to check in on us, they did this frequently with our table and I noticed they paid the same attention to other tables around us.  The night was fantastic and my only criticism, if I can muster one up, is that I wish this place was open for lunch!!

I'm sure the staff issues I'm reading about here will work themselves out.  They have only been open two weeks so let's give them a slight pass on that for now.  Great job to the staff and owners of Flight.  I will highly recommend this place and certainly look to return!

The cheese and charcuterie board was absolutely perfect with the wines. We went with the Pierre Robert, Garrotxa and Beemster Gouda for the cheeses. We chose Salami and Jamon de Bayonne for the charcuterie. None of it lasted for more than a few minutes. We decided to order snacks and entrees to share amongst the four of us. The zucchini fritters were excellent and the salsa verde with it was just took it over the top. The meatballs were made to perfection with a grilled bread to mop up the outstanding red sauce. I'm not a fan of olives and I even devoured the warm spiced olives. The ceviche was excellent and this is coming from someone who eats a lot of it and can be quite judgmental. As for the entrees we got ordered the ricotta gnocchi and pork belly ravioli. The gnocchi was a delightful surprise with the minty sweet corn purée and greens. As for the ravioli...to die for. The pork belly was smoky and succulent paired with the peach to give a full flavor profile of sweet and salty. By this point we are all so full we couldn't even think about dessert which I must say I regret.

Bar a Vin is an addition to Chez Billy, a famous French restaurant in DC.  This place is packed with a sort of old world romantic character and absolutely bursting at the seams with excellent wine.  Bar a Vin is, I will note, not the kind of place you go with a ton of friends to get hammered - the scene here is more adult, more calm, and more focused on tasting high-quality wine.

The wine here is without peer.  While there's plenty to choose from on the menu, the absolutely excellent servers can help you find something unique and amazing, and I highly recommend trusting their judgment.  Prices range the gamut, so you can certainly blow a lot of money here, but even the more affordable wine is quite tasty.

Then we finally get seated at the worlds tiniest table right next to a huge party that was treating the table like it was standing cocktail party. That table was extremely rude and kept bumping our table I told my server (who was very sweet by the way) our frustrations toward the end of the dinner and the Manager came right away, moved us, comped our meal, and told me and my friend to come back and he would make sure we had a better experience next time.

Last night my friend and I returned and the Manager took the BEST care of us. All of the servers were extremely nice and we even got a table outside, whic is the best place in the restaurant to sit. They got the fireplace going for us, we had great drinks, great tapas! We shared the Chicken Pimiento and it was hands down the best Chicken id ever had. It was so good that I jokingly asked the server for the recipe. They then actually gifted me with a copy of the actual recipe and I was FLOORED.

We head in between lunch and dinner one day to get a drink and a quick bite. Obviously, it has a Spanish concept, which is all thumbs up for me. Their tapas range from weirdest thing you have ever seen (which interests the hell out of me) to your typical Spanish tapas you see most places. We get 5 different wines and 5 different tapas, and then WOAH. Everything we ate was immaculate.

Our party LOVED the following items: jam & cheese balls- comes with 4 small balls, beef empanadas-comes with two very small empanadas, garbanzo fritters (crispy outside and perfectly soft on the inside with some sour cream and green salsa topping)- comes w 3 small sized cubes, the corn- comes in a small bowl, the summer squash- comes in a medium size bowl, the vine ripened tomatoes with whipped feta-comes with 10 or so small cherry tomatoes, and churros with spicy chocolate dipping sauce-came with four large churros and a small cup of sauce (technically this is no longer on the menu, but your server can ask the kitchen to make it). 
We didn't care for the mushrooms and the broccoli was okay.

Portions
They recommend three tapas plates per person and  you should count the charcuterie + cheese plate of 3 as 2 tapas plates. But at 3/person you WILL be stuffed.

Seating and Accessibility
I can get a bit noisy, so I suggest the back room or sitting outside. There is a ramp to get inside, but it has a sharp turn, so it might be a tight squeeze for larger electric chairs. Tables are more spaced out in the back, but there is a single small step. We came with two service dogs and the staff didn't even blink an eye- they just ensured that we had everything we needed and proceeded as normal, just as they should.

Management
Thank you for being so accessible and disability friendly! All of your staff treated our party with respect and dignity, which isn't always the case. The noise level is a little high, but I'm not sure how much you can realistically do about that...
And please put the churros back on the menu! I would also love a caramel sauce for it :)

We had a date night out so my wife and I decided to do the tapas / small plates thing. I personally enjoy the no rush opportunity to have good conversation with my wife, all while people watching. 

Barcelona Wine had gotten accolades from the WAPO, DC magazine, Yelp, you name it. 

We had reservations for 5:30 but when arriving we decided that sitting outside would have been worth the extra wait, so we got on the list to sit outside. It's worth it, if it gets a little chilly once the sun goes down they have heaters and blankets that they fire up to keep you nice and toasty. 

It was about half an hour wait on Saturday which would give you a great opportunity to walk down 14th Street and check out the scene.

When we were sat, we had two waiter / waitress serving us. I asked them ( separately) what their suggestions on the small plates were. It was interesting and helpful to see a difference in opinion but also the overlap. 

We started with charcuterie and cheese plate , picking chorizo dulce as the meat and two cheeses, 6 month Machego and the drunken goat.  The chorizo was awesome and was a 
 great compliment to the bread and cheese. It had a little spice and a great kick to it.  The drunken goat was a smooth cheese while the Machego had s nice sharp taste to it.  We could have ordered another board and had s great night, and going back we would definitely do it again. 

Our first tapas was a broccolini, sauteed in garlic. It was a good start without too heavy of a garlic taste but enough flavor to warrant eating all your vegetables. 

We got a spicy beef empanada which was good that weren't all that spicy but were flakey empanadas. The albondigas (lamb meatballs) that were a great split and highly recommend. Surprisingly we were ready for desert after. My wife asked for churros that had recently been removed from the menu. The waiter was great and got it made for my wife. I also got the cheesecake​. 

The food overall was great, atmosphere was great, service was great. All in all it was the gold standard for date night from now on. We will definitely be back

For a chain, Barcelona does an amazing job. The food was fantastic, and I tried a few small plates I hadn't had before (the octopus and tuna were phenomenal). The service was wonderful, which is always is. Our server was patient with us as we drank wine and ordered small plates and talked for basically five hours.

491,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=uqd0G-uoYzwYAuquCjfE7A,"Boy, was this place packed on a Friday night. My girlfriend had a few friends coming to town and we decided to get drinks. We arrived to Barcelona around 7 and put our names down. Am I joking? Nope. We seriously tried to get a table at 7 on a Friday. To our disbelief, we were told the wait would only be 30 minutes. Hey, not bad! All of a sudden, while we were getting drinks at the bar, 2 corner seat at the bar opened up. It was our lucky day. 

If I had a dream bar, in terms of décor, it would be Barcelona. The wood, the lighting, the beautifully large windows. These are all things I love. Oh, and the music was on point. I say all this because it sets the scene for our meal.

The bartender's served our drinks and offered up their top-line thoughts on the menu. Of course there are the restaurant's go-to eats, however newly added were sausages that the chef was particularly excited about. Side note, he was seen roaming checking in on people. We decided to order the bison sausage, mushrooms, potatoes, and seafood paella. The first 3 came out and great appetizers. The potatoes with an aioli sauce reminded my girlfriend of her time in Spain. Besides being delicious, it brought back amazing memories for her; that's the beautify of food I guess, stimulating all those senses and bringing us to an ecstasy! 

The star of the show, the headlining act, the G.O.A.T, was the paella. Wow. It was huge. It was beautiful. It was delicious. I paired it with the cheapest white wine on the menu (which was only $6.5!). Yes, cheapest, why not? It was briny and had a perfect gravel flavor that gave the shellfish a perfect compliment. We didn't end up finishing the paella and took it to go.

Barcelona is one of those restaurants that you should go to for many reasons: to celebrate something, for a 5th date or more because the food deserves to be shared with people you care about because this place is an EXPERIENCE, or just for about anything. Seriously, I had an incredible time here and hope you do too.

I recently went here for a birthday dinner of 10 people and the staff was as amazing as the food, which was top notch.  On the staff side, our main waiter and his assistant made perfect recommendations for wine pairings and tapas choices and most importantly, went to great lengths to make the birthday a very special occasion.  Specifically, our waiter had our cake, from an outside bakery, taken to the kitchen and cut and plated, so that we did not have to do it ourselves.  He also made sure our leftover cake was boxed up at the end.  To me, this was exceptionally great service, especially since the restaurant had no prior knowledge that this would be a birthday dinner; they just did it on the spot and it really wowed me.

As for the food, well everything is tasty, but it should be known that most of the tapas are very small, so when you're in a big group make sure to order a couple of each.  My favorites, in this order, were the patatas bravas, albondigas, crispy pig ears, hanger steak, gambas al ajillo, and the crispy calamari.  The wine and drink selections are also phenomenal, so it's hard to go wrong here.

I came here with a college buddy to catch up and as a vegetarian, I honestly had low expectations. We came in around 2:00 pm after walking all around the area and were fully expecting to wait. 

We were promptly seated outside, our tapas arrived super quickly and managed to stave off our hunger for our paella until it was time. And that bread - we must have ordered like 3 refills? #carboverload

Things we ordered:

Bread:
+Complimentary. The best carbs.
+Warm, fluffy, delicious.
+Order more, be shameless. 

Patatas Bravas:
+Well done, crispy on the outside, hot and lovely on the inside. Hard to mess up potatoes but trust me, it has been done.
+The bravas salsa was maravilloso.
-Not a fan of the aioli sauce, I know it is traditional but personal preference, not my thing.

Cheese plate: 
+6 month manchego - perfect in between bites of bread and broccolini. 
+Drunken Goat - you can never go wrong with a good drunken goat. 
+Idizabel - recommendation from our server, would definitely order again.

Brocollini: 
+In the wise words of one of my favorite people, ""simple and best"". Honestly a perfect pairing to everything else we ordered. 

Pan con Tomate:
+Honestly forgot I ordered this because I ate it so quickly. 10/10.

Vegetable Paella:
+I had low expectations. Most paella places manage to spectacularly screw up vegetarian paella and resort to tasteless demonstrations of seasonal vegetable displays to make up for it. This paella was tasty down to every last grain of rice. Truly pleased.

The food is consistently delicious!  My favorites are the croquetas, the hanger steak, and the seafood paella (which can easily feed 3-4 people).  The paella doesn't dance around pretending to be a Spanish dish that's made in America; It is as close to the real deal as you can get without fishing out of the Mediterranean.  The delicious red sangria tastes dangerously close to juice, but puts you on your ass.  Deceptive.  It's also not subject to the oxidized old fruit you'd find in a lesser sangria.  Two pitchers sound about right for a visit.

The service is...interesting.  You rarely have to wait for water refills or table visits from your server because you have 3-4 of them waiting on you.  It's usually a good feel, but depending on the team, it can feel impersonal.  But with the sangria, delicious food, and great conversation, it's hardly noticeable.  One big plus is that they've adopted the European spirit of lounging.  You never feel rushed to leave, and they won't even hint at getting you to take your check.

Before finding another place for tapas closer to home, I favored this spot twice a week. Starting with the complimentary bread, it had a really great texture. Sharing with someone who likes the crispy crust was perfect considering I really liked the soft and chewy middle. In my opinion it worked well as the vehicle for the cured meats, patê, and cheeses. And the olives...a plate had about 3 varieties, yay!!! 
I found it ideal to have shareable small plates since you can have multiple bites of all the yummy selections. Outside of tapas and charcuterie, they have one of the best beet salads I've had. Perfectly dressed with hardly any fillers; just yummy beets. They also have other choices that were tasty, authentic, and tasty and authentic (the anchovies were so good). 

Walking in you can see the extensive bar, which if you enjoy pairings I suggest sitting in that section so that your wait staff can properly make recommendations. The staff is friendly and helpful with introducing the menu too if you feel overwhelmed. They're also mindful of their customers' experience by making sure the excitement of enjoying drinks stays classy, if you get my drift (no loud drunks!)

My friend who lives here has come before and told me that the bread is made fresh daily in house, and you can tell without her even having to tell me, it was soooo good and the best part is that it is unlimited, which you are guaranteed to ask for more because it is that addicting.The inside was still piping hot and it literally melted in your mouth. You don't even need to eat it with anything but we asked for some oil and vinegar for dipping. 
 We ordered a few tapas, one being the hanger steak, the tortilla, empanadas, the croquetas, and a side of fries. Everything came out so fast, the minute we ordered we had all our food in about 10 minutes. The service was great and the staff was very attentive at all times, we had like 3 different waitresses/waiters attending us. Let me start off with the hanger streak that came with some truffle vinaigrette over it, it was cooked to perfection and very tasty but i found it a bit overpriced for the 4 tiny pieces it brought. Everything else we ordered was perfect in size and price. The tortilla was very good, the empanadas, which were my least favorite came in some red sauce but they weren't anything out of this world. The french fries were very good but a bit on the soggy side and last but not least i cant brag enough about the croquetas, they were absolutely DELICIOUS. I cant even describe how good they were.They're fried but the inside was so wonderfully cheesy and moist and hot over some white sauce that i have no clue what it was but it was absolutely  delectable. Coming from Miami where the croquetas are pretty amazing, this one beat any croqueta in Miami. I wanted to take some home on the plane of how good they were. I kept dreaming about them the next day because i wanted more! Defiantly coming back next time i visit DC

But if I was a morning person (which I am most definitely not) and they had some breakfast, I could love this place even more.

Whenever friends come visit, I take them here. They always leave happy and can't manage to stop talking about how great this place is. I feel the same way every time I leave this wonderful place.

What I love/adore/am obsessed over:
1) Meat & cheese board.
Do yourself a favor and get a meat & cheese board. I'm more of a meat eater, so I naturally get two meats and a cheese. 

1) The sangria.
You should also get a pitcher of sangria. Don't waste your time with a glass when you should just go ahead and get a pitcher. My favorite is the seasonal red. A close second is the classic red. To be honest, I just favor red wine over white.

3) Happy hour.
If you're new to the lovely place of Barcelona, their tapas happy hour is the best way to make your way around their menu. It's like $1-3 per item. If you tend to have a favorite item, then I'd recommend getting the normal portion of that deliciousness to save yourself time and dinero.
My favorite items: hanger steak and torta.

4) Monday = 1/2 priced bottles of wine.
I don't really feel the need to further explain this awesome point.

5) The churros.
Fried dough that's dippable in chocolate or dulce de leche. I should also mention these are the biggest churros of my life.

What I would recommend:
Making a reservation. I've gotten extremely lucky where the stars line up perfectly, and I haven't had to wait [yet] and just snag some table near the bar. Now that I've jinxed myself, I will be making a reservation from now on.

We've been to both the 14th street location and the Cathedral Heights location multiple times--it's a great place for special occasions, somewhere to take friends and family visiting from out of town, or just a fun date night. 

Their food is amazing--they change their menu pretty regularly, so they always have something fun and new to try. And they're very serious about making sure they have authentic foods--we were chatting with the manager one time and he told us that (managers and/or chefs) from each location take an annual trip to Spain to try out different recipes, cheese, wines, oils, etc. 

The only thing that might be better than their food is their service. The dishes almost always come out very promptly, and on the very few occasions where we've had a dish that was really delayed, the waiters and managers are always really good about making it up to you (taking that dish off your bill and/or bringing you another dish with their compliments).

573,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=hVwP23xSIbIIFCWjuYcYlw,"I have a few initial observations to make before I chronicle my fantastic dining experience at Barcelona. The foremost regards the pricing; $$$ is a slight misrepresentation being that one could plausibly enjoy a $$ priced meal here if one decided to. Secondly, and most importantly, Barcelona is unequivocally the most authentic Spanish restaurant in the District. Here is why. 

Craving a something that was neither Americana nor overtly ethnic, my spouse and I decided upon Spanish cuisine. Furthermore, we both previously resided in Spain and desired to try a seemingly popular spot in town that carries the cuisine of Spain, Barcelona. We were elated upon sight of the menu. Patatas Bravas, Jamon Croquettes, Jamon Serrano, Manchego Cheese, Gambas al Ajillo, Empanadas, Albondigas, and Squid Ink Fideos. To drink, Sangria, Sherry, Porto, and vino from the Rioja. Barcelona is Spanish Cuisine heaven. 

To begin, we selected the Jamon and Croquettes. The Jamon melted in the mouth as it should, a perfect blend of fat and lean, while the Croquettes were flawless. Perhaps our infatuation with the Croquettes is due to the amount of time we have been detached from Spain but nevertheless, these were phenomenal. I highly recommend. 

We followed these two dishes with the Patatas Bravas and Squid Ink Fideos. The Patatas were, much akin to everything else here, authentic and delectable. It is hard to believe that Spanish restaurants in the U.S. cannot nail this dish but I have not been contented with Patatas Bravas until I ate here. An ideal blend of the ""hot"" sauce and their perfected Alioli-not to mention the bread deserves Five Stars. 

The Squid Ink Fideos truly blew me away. This dish is considered a delicacy in Spain, rightfully so, and I was exhilarated to see the Barcelona carried this dish. Priced at $14.50, this dish is reasonably priced and generously portioned. If you are a bit more adventurous and not averse trying authentic, hallowed Spanish food, this is the dish for you. 

For libations, I had the Gimlet and a liberally apportioned glass of Port for dessert. Both drinks were suitably priced, especially for the area, and ambrosial. All things considered, Barcelona is one of my favorite restaurants in the District of Columbia, deserving to bring any guest I have.

This is a Spanish tapas bar-hence the name. It has an excellent selection of wine and cocktails. The food is absolutely delicious and they don't assign a waiter to your table so multiple wait staff keep the service quick and efficient since it is always packed.

The kitchen is open until 12PM. We ordered the Serrano Ham (so good), two cheeses, papas fritas, roasted artichoke, fiddlehead bread, veggie paella, squid ink ""pasta"", crepes and the chocolate cake. They give you freshly baked bread from a local bakery that is delivered in the morning. Everything was amazing...I don't have a single compliant.

We we seated in the back corner area of the restaurant where it was much calmer and quieter. The decor/vibe is super trendy, with lots of wood and candle light. Very nice interior and a decent patio. 

They have a very healthy wine list of Spanish and Latin American wines. We both went with one of the Granachas at the waiter's recommendation and were not disappointed. 

Waiter recommended three-four plates for a person, and having ordered seven between the two of us I think this was a very accurate call. We left feeling very full and satisfied. 

We began with plates of charcuterie and cheese - the standard jamon plate and the San Simon cheese. Both were wonderful; I've missed Spanish jamon, and the cheese was fairly similar to Gouda in appearance and taste. Next up were the croquettes, and wow these were delectable. They're fried but the inside was so wonderfully cheesy and moist and hot. 10/10. We were also very thrilled with the patatas bravas - nothing revolutionary, just darn good. We followed this up with the sautéed broccoli, which had a bit of garlic and was good but nothing special. The albondigas meatballs were perfectly cooked with plenty of sauce, and we finished up the meal with the figs and yogurt, which were a sweet way to wrap things up.

The Whipped Sheep's Cheese was extra smooth and creamy WOW. The pistachio really made the dish shine. 
We were recommended the Chanquetes but it was okay. Overall the portion was a bit large given that it was all fried and it was hard to finish once the dish cooled down.
The Potato Tortilla was fantastic, and I would recommend it as it's a classic tapas dish.
Probably my favorite dish was the Spicy Eggplant Caponata, though it was not very spicy at all. The flavors were so powerful in this little dish and it tasted even better with some of their fresh bread.

Speaking of bread - addicting. I haven't tasted bread with that much character in a while. The inside was still piping hot and it literally melted in your mouth. You don't even need to eat it with anything.

Paid roughly $30 per person and left extremely satisfied. I can't wait to come here again. Thanks for the memories Barcelona!

The sangria was like none I've ever had. We went with the red whine, and the color was more purple than I'm used to, but the server insisted they don't use any artificial coloring there. You have an option between two kinds of liquors, and we were able to try both since we ordered to pitchers of sangria. It was super tasty and not too strong, though it was strong enough to give a good buzz.

We had an assortment of appetizers, the vegetable paella and three of their desserts. Everything was amazing, especially their red meat tapas and calamari.

Ended up popping in late on a Wednesday night (probably after 10pm or so) after a show at the Lincoln Theatre and the place was almost packed - full of people and buzzing all over from bar to patio indoor and out. Luckily no wait for a table for two and service was exceptional. Our waitresses were phenomenal; main person serving I think said her name was Marley. She was superb - she heard my sister dining with me was having a rough week at work and took REALLY good care of us (red sangria on the house and some pours from the porran filled with riesling, lemon juice, and lemon-lime soda good). The drinks were really tasty. We had charcuterie + cheese (jamon and goat cheeses with quince paste) with bread, NY strip steak, octopus, Spanish tortilla, and watermelon salad with mint and cheese. Everything was fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this place, especially if you love tapas or Spanish food in general.

However, my mother was visiting and really wanted wine, so we headed over to 14th street to meet up with one of her friends who also lives in the city. 

Our two servers, Stephen and Deshawn, were amongst the best waiters I've ever experienced. They provided on point suggestions for wine and food, joined in on our crazy conversations and made us feel like friends. We were at Barcelona for nearly 3 hours, yet never felt rushed or unwelcome. The two of them together were an excellent team and I will ask for them specifically the next time I return (which is probably going to be next week). 

For wine, we drank two bottles of the Earth Fire Malbec. It was a wonderful choice: easy to drink, complex flavor, perfect for January evening sitting outside (!!) under the heat lamps. We weren't particularly hungry, but ordered the sun choke hummus, crispy brussel sprouts, and jamon and chicken croquettes. They were all delicious and the bread and olive oil were necessary to soak up the remaining sauces and hummus. As we were waiting for our check, the staff brought out a delicious warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, on the house, and we were taken aback. It was such a nice gesture that we truly appreciated.

I hope a manager reads this, as Stephen and Deshawn should be commended for their work. Thank you for a wonderful evening!

And although the experience each time has been nothing short of exceptional, last nights was the best! I already had a dinner a little earlier so a friend and I went in just for a glass of wine and some cheese and bread. We ordered the manchego cheese (one of my favorites) and a manager walked by asking how we were doing. He saw that the Membrillo, the jam paste served with the manchego cheese, hadn't been touched and proceeded to tell us about it. I love exotic and unique food items that come with a story so I was interested in learning more. Next thing you know, the chef came out to tell me more about it and how it's made. I was so intrigued that he offered to send me home with some. I figured I'd just be given a sample size amount, especially since they only serve a pittance of it along with the cheese (it's expensive). Few minutes later, the GM Nevin walked over and gave me this large tub of the Membrillo and said it was a gift from Chef Alex! It was the sweetest thing. I mean, I have come to Barcelona 3 times in the last two weeks alone, so that should tell you how much I love their food!

We listened to her and order 3 portions for the paella and it was perfect (size wise), people got servings of 2nds and 3rds (think the size of your hand).

Summary (on a scale of 1 to 5 stars):
Food: 5 stars
Drinks: 5 stars
Atmosphere: 5 stars
Service: 4 stars
Price: 4 stars

Food: 5 stars
Everything was remarkable. I got the lamb burger + added a sunny side up egg on top. Oh man, I would eat that burger every day if I could. The burger was juicy. The tzatziki sauce was cool and creamy, and the fried onion straws (that came ON the burger) add the perfect crunch. We also ordered croquettes for the table to start that were perfectly creamy. Get them.

Drinks: 5 stars
During brunch, there is a bloody mary bar. If you want one, they bring you a glass with the vodka in it, and then you go up to the bloody mary bar to make your drink. There are different mixes, fresh herbs, lemon and lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, homemade beef jerky, bacon, celery pickles, cheese cubes, peppers.....need I go on? EVERYTHING you could want in the bloody-- it's there. Overwhelmed? Don't worry-- there is a server tending the bloody mary bar specifically to help you concoct your drink. They happily helped us as much and as little as we wanted. 

Atmosphere: 5 stars
Go when it's nice out. The Patio is wonderful. And if it's a bit chilly there are outdoor heaters. You can people watch while eating (always entertaining on 14th street). Great lively atmosphere.

Service: 4 stars
Overall the service was ok. It took about 10 minutes for our server to come over to us initially, which is a fairly long time to sit and wait. But, once we got our drinks and food orders in, everything went very smoothly.

Price: 4 stars
Well-priced. I think the bloody mary bar was $10 for one drink, which is fairly average for a tall premium cocktail. The entree prices were very reasonable at about $15 a plate. No bottomless drink option, but the quality here makes up for that.

LOVED it! I would go back in a second. If you haven't been, especially for brunch, doo it! Also they are not on opentable but they DO take reservations. You just have to call them.

654,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=HN8iIRk7TtlPVlvQAxMDXQ,"I came here for the first time to celebrate my birthday with a group of ten friends. The restaurant had been suggested by numerous people as a great place to grab a delicious meal or fun happy hour drink so it immediately came to mind when I was racking my brain for a place with a lively atmosphere that could accommodate a larger group. My first experience at the restaurant definitely did not disappoint (despite a small timing hiccup when we first arrived) and I'm already looking forward to going back! The management team and wait staff went above and beyond to make sure my birthday dinner was just as fun as it was delicious.

I called about ten days out and was originally hoping to make an 8:00pm reservation on a Saturday night but, due to several larger groups already scheduled, the owner suggested we push it to 8:45pm to give the previous reservations enough time to finish before arriving. While great in theory, the extra 45 minutes didn't turn out to be enough time because when our party arrived, we had to wait another 45 minutes to be seated. While probably frustrating to some in the group, I wasn't concerned because the host and hostess were extremely friendly, transparent, and apologetic about the delay. The wait also gave us some time to grab a drink at the bar, which was packed but the bartenders were very quick and efficient in serving everyone (not to mention, they made really really good cocktails!). 

When we were finally seated, our two waiters came over immediately to again offer an apology as well as three bottles of champagne and three charcuterie boards on the house. This generous display of hospitality more than made up for the wait time! Our servers were attentive and quick throughout of entire meal and their tapas recommendations were spot on. My two favorites were definitely the patatas bravas and jamon & chicken croquettes - both were SOOOO beyond delicious and I can't imagine going back and not ordering them again and again and again. I also ordered scallops and the hanger steak which were both well prepared but simply not as tasty as the other two dishes. 

All in all, I'm so happy that I decided to try Barcelona for my birthday dinner - from the atmosphere to the service to the management team to the amazing food and drinks, everything was top notch! Highly highly highly recommend for larger groups or just a fun night out!

(I used to date someone who worked here briefly way back when). After being convinced by my friend and fellow elite Sanaa that we should go; we headed her on a late Thursday night for a good evening that turned into 3.5 hours of a good time.

We initially were going to eat a table, but after waiting a few minutes,  Sanaa scored us 2 bar seats with an ideal view of scouting out the scene and people watch. 

During this time she struck up a conversation with two older Peruvian men exchanging stories and I talked to the cool lady bartenders. Some weird things happened while I sat there. For instance, some random guy with dreads came up behind me smacked my ass and kissed me on the cheek. That wasn't awkward for me at all. *sarcasm* Then another guy by accident took my drink instead of his.... this was after the other incident because he was sitting next to me with a couple other people. I simply got it replaced without charge. 

We didn't pay for any drinks the whole night. Sanaa had two complimentary Barcelona coins that allows you to get a free glass of wine, tapas, or cocktail of your choice. Barcelona usually offers these when you fill out a survey at the end of your meal to let them know how the service and quality of your meal was. We only had 2 drinks. 1 from Sanaa and one for my belayed birthday from the manager of Barcelona. 

For my dinner I ordered from the entree menu to get one of the meat boards that came with steak, pork tenderloin, chicken, and one long pork sausage for $24.50. Usually this is meant to be split between 2 people. I ate what I could and had it for 2 more meals over the next couple of days after. It was delicious.

694,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=LhqM7pA1jnKjZIPOKmOing,"Ever since my return to the DC area a couple years ago, many friends have repeatedly told me that I need to try this place and I finally got the opportunity last weekend. Seldom is every expectation met when anything is hyped up at great length, but Barcelona didn't just meet all my expectations... it exceeded them... all of them. It was a celebratory evening with a 10-person party for a friend's birthday. For large parties, they will do a 4-course tapas dinner $35/person. These are not your standard 4-courses... each course is comprised of several tapas dishes... amounting to a whole lotta food. So many plates hit our table at such a rapid pace that I lost count and thought we were done midway through the third course.

Our conquistador-sized meal included (but was not limited to):
Spicy Eggplant Caponata; Hamachi Crudo garnished with Passion Fruit, Aji Amarillo, Radishes; Patatas Bravas in Salsa Brava and Garlic Aioli; Red & Golden Beet Salad with Manchego Cheese and Marcona Almond; Spinach-Chickpea Cazuela seasoned with Cumin and Roasted Garlic, Oyster En Escabeche; Watermelon Radish Salad, Gambas al Ajillo (Shrimp in Garlic, Hot Pepper, Olive Oil), Grilled Hanger Steak drizzled with a Black Truffle Vinaigrette; Crispy Calamari served with a Smoked Pepper Aioli; Grilled Lamb Chops served with Arugula and Romesco sauce; Sauteed Skate Wing... and I'm certain I forgot stuff.

My personal favorites were the Sauteed Skate Wing, Hamachi Crudo, Oysters and Grilled Lamb Chops. SO. INCREDIBLY. FULL. It felt like like the entire menu hit our table. It was so good that I wanted to keep eating more food despite there being absolutely no room left in my stomach.

Overall, the food was awesome and the service was top-notch. They even cut the cake we brought for our friend's birthday saving us the trouble of cutting it ourselves. I've never been to Barcelona (the city), but this place makes me want to. Barcelona (the restaurant) seems to be great for every occasion -- casual get-togethers, date night, group outings.

So glad I was in DC for her friend's Bachelorette party coz I got to join them in the festivities! They chose to have the dinner here before things got crazy the rest of the evening! Karen wanted to have a low-key evening, but let's just say we had different plans for her! 

The outdoor area is fantastic!  If you get a chance, eat outside.  Unfortunately, our party of 10 was seated inside, but that was okay because they have floor to ceiling glass walls and doors, so you feel like you're outdoors! 

As we were a big group, the restaurant gave us the option of letting the restaurant choose and bring out a variety of vegetarian and meat dishes for $35 per person.  We could let them know if we wanted more of certain dishes or add something else.  We decided to do that, as we wanted to chat and not study the menu. We ordered 3 pitchers of Sangria to start and added an order of seafood and an order of vegetarian paella to the food order. 

We had plenty of food and many of the dishes were quite good.  Some of the best were the paella, the albondigas, the croquettes, the eggplant caponata, the patatas bravas, the spinach-chickpea cazuela, and the ribeye a la plancha.  The sangrias were excellent too. I ordered a separate glass of Sangria Flora which has St. Germain in it. Order it! I often make that at home coz it's so delicious! 

At the end of the meal, they told us that we had not eaten enough to for the $35 pp, so they were going to use the rest of that for the dessert. They brought us a few desserts that we can share.  The churros with chocolate dipping sauce were great!

725,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=LqcDdp4xb7OzPzGpfYgQiQ,"Great experience. My boyfriend and were looking for a quick date night for a Thursday, and I had been here once before for drinks with friends. I called around 7:15 as we were in the area to see if we could go immediately, and the hostess told us they could fit us in which was great! The ambiance reminds me a lot of an NYC feel, always busy but never crazy/rambunctious like many of the bars on the same strip of 14th. We had two servers, and they were extremely knowledgeable of the menu (both wine and food) and they gave us a lot of useful background on which options we could order.

My boyfriend got this 2013 Finca Millara Lagariza red which we absolutely obsessed over: no acidity, so delicious. We literally talked about how good it was for longer than normal people should discuss wine at dinner.   

For appetizer, we ordered the charcuterie (their own house prosciutto, a triple crème cows milk cheese identical to brie, and a wine drunken goat cheese that was medium firm). We were both starving, and ordered 4 tapas for dinner instead of going with the paella (although the various paellas looked mouthwatering). 

I specific really liked the fact that their tapas are not like the baby tapas you get at places like Zaytinya of Jaleo (two shrimps, or one damn scallop) . The tapas are hearty portion sizes and we were stuffed having 3 meat tapas and one broccolini tapa (which was surprisingly spicier than I anticipated and delicious!!!). We ordered a squid ink fideos tapas, which ended up having a piece of what we thought was plastic but the manager Andy explained was a part of the squid vertebrae the chef missed taking out. Nevertheless, Andy immediately took the plate away, brought us a brand new one, apologized profusely, and took it off of our bill. NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE!!! 

For dessert we got the churros, but at that point we were too stuffed to even finish it. All in all, one of the more pleasant experiences I've had at a DC restaurant. No doubt it is pricey, but I would say that because you have to order less tapas you're saving in the end in comparison to other nearby tapas restaurants. Additionally, you get what you pay for: EXCELLENT food, amazing ambiance, and great service.

A few months ago I tried to walk in without a reservation and they laughed in my face after my look of shock from being told there would be a 2 hour wait. But I digress, places like this must be packed full every night for a reason. 

We arrived at our reservation time of 8:30 and were seated promptly- outside (tip- when you make a reservation THEY decide if you're going to sit inside or out). It had been raining all day and we voiced some concern to our waiter but he assured us that it would hold out. After ordering a nice bottle of wine (which was a delicious suggestion of our waiter) it, of course, started to rain to the point of people putting napkins on their heads and opening umbrellas. Long story short, we stood inside a bit and were going to close out or tab without getting dinner when the manager told us that he had a table open up inside. And good thing we stayed because the food was well worth it! 

We started with the Fuet and Manchego cheese which was so delicious. The Gambas al Ajillo were amazing- buttery, garlicky and perfectly spicy. The grilled avocado was simple yet so tasty and the Chicken and Jamon Croquettes were SO good. The hanger steak was good but definitely paled in comparison to the other tapas.

We had the mangalica ham, a Spanish cheese (not machego) and the truffled sheep's cheese.  All excellent.  We also had, among others, the shishito peppers, albondigas, sunchokes, and pan con huevo.

745,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=HbtDu8f3fxT6A3xubLYfGQ,"Barcelona!!!  Brings back memories of my recent trip to Spain.  Since another tour of Europe is not in the cards anytime soon, this aptly named restaurant will have to do.  Barcelona is a semi-national chain with the majority of their locations being on the east coast.  I showed up late one weeknight with low expectations.  Spanish food is delicious, however, Spanish food or Latin food in general is an atrocity in DC.  To make matters worse, I had just been to another hotspot, Estadio, and was treated to a massive failure.  

The décor of this restaurant is sleek and sexy.  It also had a certain warmth that radiated from the environment to the staff.  Speaking of the staff, the service is awesome.  Our server was very helpful and really good at offering objective feedback as opposed to trying to shamelessly upsell.  The manager is also great as he checked on our table a few times and apologized for a dish we sent back.  

Given that this was Spanish cuisine being served tapas style, sampling is the way to go.  We tried the Whipped Sheep's Cheese, Buttered Corn, Spicy Beef Empanada, Hanger Steak, Watermelon Radish Salad, Patatas Bravas, Swordfish a la Plancha and Crepas Salguero.  

The Whipped Sheep's Cheese is similar to a feta cheese dip.  In fact, it's even more like spicy cream cheese.  Absolutely delicious.  You get a hint of tang, a little salt and a bit of heat in each bite.  Definitely addicting.  

The Buttered Corn was buttered and seasoned, making it quite tasty.  I also loved the plumpness and juiciness of the corn, as opposed to being dried out.

The Spicy Beef Empanada is a tad bit small, even for a tapas dish.  Perhaps I'm just pointing that out because it was good enough for me to want more.  The empanadas are packed with balanced flavors that come right out.  None of the flavors are overwhelming, but are rather cohesive.  I also appreciated that the shell was moist and easy to bite into.

The Watermelon Radish Salad was the only fail of the night.  The term watermelon is not the best descriptor other than for the colors of the dish.  Basically, these were sliced radishes that were dipped in lemon.  Super duper sour.  Imagine the most sour thing you can imagine, and multiply that by 3.  That's this dish.  The staff was great about taking it back and removing it from the bill.  

The Patatas Bravas is a classic comfort food dish of potatoes and sauces.  It was a simple dish that just seems to hit the spot.  The potatoes were nicely prepared, seasoned, and the sauces provided a variety of elements like creaminess, acid, tang, spice, etc.

The Swordfish a la Plancha is also a pretty straight forward dish.  The swordfish was thick, meaty and had some smokiness from being grilled.  It was just a tad dry, but nothing significant.

The Hanger Steak continues the trend of being simple and straight forward.  The star is no doubt the steak, which was relatively tender.  I do wish the black truffle vinaigrette offered a little more flavor though.  Nonetheless, the steak was quality.  

The Crepas Salguero is basically taking a French dish and putting a little bit of a Latin spin on it.  Just before ordering, I warned the waitress by telling her that I had amazing crepes in Paris not too long ago, and had become a bit of a crepe snob.  She was honest in saying that a comparison between the two wouldn't be fair, but judged on it's own merits, this dish would be good.  Boy, that was an understatement.  These crepes were delicious.  They were delicate and moist, which is harder to pull off than people realize.  The usage of dulce de leche and chocolate sauce added some flavor complexities.  The dulce took on the role of a cream filling, which elevated things even more.  Definitely one of the best desserts I've had in DC.

Prices are not bad at all.  The bill came to about $75.  

Five stars is a big deal, especially in my world.  You really have to score high in every category to be worthy.  I'm not saying Barcelona is the greatest thing ever, but considering my experience and the fact that it outclasses so many places in DC, giving them that honor just feels right.  Viva Barcelona!!

We made reservations which is definitely the way to go because they get super packed. The restaurant space is huge and open and the outdoor seating area was beautiful. On a Friday night, the place was super packed. The entrance was blocked by many different parties waiting to be seated. 

When we were seated we ordered a pitcher of the red sangria. It was tasty but a little too sweet for me and I wish I could taste a bit more of the wine. They also brought us hot fresh bread. The sound of the crust was music to my ears, for the Ratatouille fans out there. 

Overall I was surprised how filling and reasonably priced their tapas were. Our favorites were the skate wing (the sauce was delicious and the fish was cooked perfectly), asparagus (huge portion of deliciously grilled spears served with a unique spring onion pesto), and the foie gras (super rich and nicely paired with a bright blueberry arugula salad). The paella was also very filling and flavorful. A one person serving was more than enough to share between the three of us. 

The service was impeccable. They gave us a complimentary tapas: the ham and cheese croquettes which were surprisingly delightful! I would definitely order these again. Also when they mixed up the cooking temperature of our hangar steak, they not only brought out a correction, they also took if the whole tapa from our bill. 

At the end of the meal, if you write a comments form, you get a free drink token to come back! So suffice it to say that they have convinced me with food quality, service, and the promise of free drinks to come back.

That's usually the case for any good happy hour spot in DC, so just go early so you can grab a seat and enjoy your evening there. Oh, did I mention hh starts at 4 here?! 

So the bf and I ordered a pitcher of white wine sangria, patatas bravas, chicken + jamon croquettas, and bread. The sangria was super good. It was on the fruity side with less of the wine taste but there was def a good balance of wine and juice in there. The patatas bravas were good but not amazing (to be fair, I'm comparing them to the ones I had in Spain). The chicken + jamon croquettes were really good. This was my favorite! It was crispy on the outside, nice creamy and gooey in the inside. The bread was just freshly baked bread with some olive oil but the bread was pretty good for something so plain.

Only great things to say about this place. Our waiter was super nice and told us popular tapas/tapas he liked best. We pretty much ordered what he mentioned (also because they sounded amazing too). We got the sauteed skate wing, hanger steak, lamb chops, cauliflower, gambas, churros. 

Skate wing- like WOW. Best fish I've ever had. Tender, flakey, moist. - it was cooked in this oliveoil-lemon sauce that was amazing. (I love citrus and think it is the best for seafood so I loved it). 

Hanger steak - that char/flavor on the outside crust - so goood, and yet the middle was so moist and tender and just meaty flavor. I can't even describe it - just ..delicious MEAT.

cauliflower - pretty decent- we wanted a veggie and our recommended this or asparagus. The raisins went really well with the cauliflower, and the curry-ish flavor was good. Cauliflower was not my favorite growing up, but they really seasoned it well so it was good.

gambas - don't let the tiny plate of 5 shrimp fool you. It is quite delicious. Their lemony sauce was just amazing. I kept telling my boyfriend I wanted a spoon so I could drink it. It was a less oily citrus sauce for the shrimp as compared to the sauce for the skate (but the olive oil in the skate sauce made it so tender and moist.)

lamb chops- so the waiter never asked us how we wanted our hanger steak or lamb chops cooked. The hanger steak came out ok; it was still pink in the middle. The lamb chops however, came out way too overcooked. Flavor was good; it had a nice char on the outside, but the meat came out a little tough and dry. We asked our waiter if we could get it cooked medium rare, and when it came out again it was cooked to perfection. Great seasoning and oh the juicy goodness of those lamb chops. 

Churros- yummy goodness. Personally I thought they used a little too much cinnamon. It managed to overwhelm the heaping amount of sugar on the churro. But, the dough was yummy and loved their dark chocolate dipping sauce!

Service: At first I thought service was kind of slow - but you can't really blame them. They were packed and had very little down time. In regards to the lamb chops, what was nice was that the manager was the one who came to deliver the redone lamb chops and she came to check to see how it was. To our surprise, they actually comped us the lamb chops! We were not expecting that at all. 
Also, we came to celebrate my birthday and they comped us some DELICIOUS chocolate cake (I'm not even sure I can call it cake) with a scoop of ice cream with a candle. The cake was so rich and decadent - It was almost like chocolate fudge.

I've heard their sangria was amazing, but I didn't end up trying one.

We (party of 2) showed up without a reservation at about 645pm on a Thursday and were told the wait would be an hour to an hour and a half.  We kind of expected this as the place is really popular.  I was beginning to get frustrated after an hour and half when they asked us to wait by the kitchen (which is open and beautiful and just looking at the meat hanging and the cheese selection and the plates coming out is cool!) and gave us complimentary sangria while they cleaned our table.

Lets start with the staff: There were about 3 to 5 people who stopped by the table to give us menus, water, bread, take orders or make sure we were happy. The waiter was also extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  He was able to help us select a great wine (based on the flavors and finish we described) and he guided us to diversify our choices as everything they were ordering was heavy and rich.  I thought this was a great suggestion and really made the meal of tapas flow better (and I think he saved the best for last). 

Unlike some tapas places where you leave hungry, Barcelona's dishes (at least the ones we ordered) were filling and rich - especially the beef and fig which was oh so delicious (you couldn't tell which pieces were meat and which were figs until you put your fork in it!).  They also serve warm fresh bread to go along with the meat and cheese plates.

Dishes - The meats and cheeses were great and came with the small sampling of jellies for the perfect pairings. I wasn't the biggest fan of the squash soup.  The croquettes were amazing!  We also ordered something with truffle and we could smell the truffle when they set the plate on table.

Barcelona really seemed to have it all under wraps:  great food, cool ambiance, knowledgeable staff, good wine.

I also happened to get a free dish (they thought we'd ordered this cheese plate that we hadn't, in fact, ordered, so they gave it to us) the most recent time I was there with my mother and boyfriend, which was a very pleasant surprise!  

I'm a huge fan of tapas, having studied abroad in Spain, and my standards for them are high, but I fully approve of Barcelona's menu. They do slightly change their repertoire of dishes each season (if you're coming in this fall, definitely try the spinach cazuela), but standards like the tortilla de patata (my favorite) are consistently available. Overall, highly recommended.

So we were (or at least, I was) expecting to turn up to a place that's semi deserted at most, especially given that it was a random Tuesday night.  I stand corrected.  We showed up and the place was packed to the gills.  

And we were (or at least, I was) expecting that it would be a while before our table is ready given how busy it is.  I stand corrected.  We were shown to our table immediately. 

Our server quickly went over the menu and based on his suggestions we had 

(a) six-month aged Manchego (a bit too dry for my liking but I'm no big fan of hard cheese.  Friend who ordered it thought it was great;

833,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=vASaF47nWvCHEEDA8nfCVw,"To be fair, I stumbled in here with a friend by accident. It opened tonight. And I do not regret it for a moment.

A newly opened restaurant deserves its fair share of ""Well... it's new."" Yet somehow, it would be easy to believe that Barcelona had been open for months. The bartender was exceptionally knowledgeable about the food, the wine, and the sherry. Whatever question we fielded was answered not just with ease, but expertise. After leaving, I actually felt like I could describe their menus in detail--a welcome note.

And I would be remiss if I did not mention the food. A wine at cheese plate, just as easy to fail as excel,  was impeccable. The jamon serrano had perfectly melty lardo, the sheep's milk cheese a delightfully fatty rind (with rosemary, no less), and a delightfully moldy (not foot-flavored) goat's cheese. The fig was a ""perfect newton filling,"" in the best of ways, and the sherried cherries were delightful. 

A wine flight was well matched. And well priced, a welcome relief in this city of $20+ wine flights.

And I'm not a dessert person. But, hey, it's opening night and they seem to be handing things out, so when the flan comes by, who am I to turn it down? Never, not ever, have I had a flan so custardy, flavorful, and appropriate for the venue. Somehow the dark vanilla cream matches the wood, the steel, the glass, the dim lighting, of a beautiful restaurant.

How did I miss the wood-burning fireplace? And the deck? Perhaps because I sat inside. But no, next time--and there will be a next time, sometime soon--I will sit, the smell of the blistering hardwoods, the warmth of a glass of sherry, the glazed eye of an ecstatic Washingtonian, transported, if only for a moment, across the sea to a warmer place, one with truly fantastic victuals and perfect pours of wine.

While visiting my sister in the district this past weekend, we had plans to hit up a few of her favorite spots on Saturday night to get some food and drinks. She was really adamant about starting out our night here, as they offer small plates and great drinks, along with a perfect atmosphere for sitting outside on a chilly fall night and  people-watching.

Our party of 3 arrived at around 5:30, and since it was pretty crowded, we put our name in with the friendly host and asked to be notified when a seat by the outdoor fireplace opened up. While we waited, we snagged a few seats at the bar and ordered some drinks. I started with the Caipi Porto, and Aperitivo (smaller, lighter drink). It reminded me of a mojito without the effervescence. It was a tad too sweet for me, but I still enjoyed it. My sister got The Enabler, which was their play on a mojito. I  tried it and knew that I had to order it at some point - it was delicious!

We waited about 20 minutes for a table outside to open up. We were seated right next to the fireplace, and they gave us fuzzy blankets to keep us warm. My sister wanted to get prosecco, so we decided to order a bottle for $26. It ended up giving us about 6 glasses between the 3 of us. 

Food-wise we went with the hanger steak, the swordfish, the chicken liver mousse, and the pork ribs. EVERYTHING was amazing. The steak was perfectly cooked and was served with a velvety mushroom sauce. The swordfish was tender and meaty and the chicken liver mousse was the best I have ever had. 

Service was perfect for the most part. Our waiter seemed a bit off at first, but by the end of the meal he was very attentive and personable. He even gave us our bottle of prosecco for free because he had initially told us that they were out. Great customer service!

The atmosphere was what made the whole experience unforgettable. Nothing beat being right next to the warm fire as the sun went down and it became chillier. The blankets were a great touch as well.

843,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=xzvQnFfa0i5fWjvcVGHDoQ,"Te amo la comida de Espana.  I was excited when the tapas craze took hold in the US because all of a sudden there were a ton of options in the major foodie cities for people like me who fell in love with the food of Spain trudging through the streets of Barcelona during my whirlwind four day visit there a few years back.
Since I spend a lot of time in DC I have hit most of the major Spanish restaurants (Estadio, Jaleo, La Tasca etc) as well as some of the more interesting offshoots where they use the small plates concept with different cuisines (Oyamel, China Chilcano), but for some reason I had overlooked this place.  Perhaps it was because I was somewhat obsessed with the food at Estadio until my last visit there (see my review on how I fell out of love with Estadio).  So it was that I found myself here a few weeks ago to get my fix of tapas.  
I normally worry when I show up solo at a restaurant and it is packed.  I usually get shuffled off to the bar or some tiny table in a corner where I am lucky if I see a waiter more than twice.  Not the case here.  It was busy when I arrived and I was given the option to take a table in the bar area, which I did.  That eing said, service was attentive and quick.  The food came to the table in steady succession and I was never left wanting for refills of food or wine.  
I am nothing if not predictable so it was that I started with the Serrano ham.  I would eat it every day if I could but my doctor would not be amused.  The version here is solid and can be combined with other items on a charcuterie plate such as manchengo cheese (which I also had) sausages, preserves, etc.    Next up was an heirloom tomato gazpacho.  Served perfectly chilled and sweet with just a bit of tang.  It was delicious and perfect for the warm evening.  I also had a foie gras dish which was a sort of sausage.  It was the only thing that disappointed.  The flavor was odd for foie gras and tasked more like a breakfast sausage.  The texture was not the smooth texture I associate with foie gras. Not bad but not what I expected.
When the server asked me what I liked best about the dishes I ordered I tld her hands down the heirloom tomato gazpacho.  I then ranked the others and mentioned that I wasn't crazy about the foie gras.  I am not a complainer mind you, and I didn't exactly say I disliked the dish, just that it was not what I expected.  
Later, when the check arrived the server let me know that she took the foie gras off of the check.  I did not ask for this and frankly do not like to make a fuss so it is the last thing I would have expected.  But I think it speaks to the level of service and training of the staff that they are taking care of customers this way and making sure they leave happy.  It was a nice gesture and I appreciated it, which along with the food and the rest of the service merit this place 5 stars.

Then the food...yum!  The bread they put on the table with olive oil is delicious. We ordered chicken empanadas, chicken croquettes, a beet salad and several other tapas style dishes which were all flavorful and staggered nicely so the dishes didn't arrive all at the same time.

900,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=1IwMubSi0KUwG1Er5yRq3Q,"So me and my boyfriend tried the Tasting Menu at Barcelona once again. OMG! One of the best dining experiences as of yet. Barcelona really out did itself this time around. We got there at 8:00 a Thursday night and the restaurant was packed. However, I do enjoy the feeling of a place full of people but yet so intimate at the same time. This time we met Nicole, one of the managers and she was amazing and recommended us an array of tapas and definitely made our experience an excellent one.

We found out that Barcelona's menu has many new plates that if you haven't tried, should definitely go back for! We were seated promptly and ordered to glasses of red wine. The first thing that came out was a meat and cheese platter. My favorite cheese was the Romao a Rosemary Cured, Firm Sheep's Cheese that was amazingly soft. One observation was that compared to other wine bars in D.C., Barcelona's portions for Meats and Cheeses are very generous. You definitely get your money's worth with their meats and cheese selections. A few minutes later one of the Chef's came to our table with Jamón Mangalica. Having traveled all over Spain and coming from a heavily Spanish inspired culture, the quality of the Mangalica was top notch. Not only that, but the experience of having the chef cut the ham table side was really cool. 

Throughout the dinner we had many small plates from the kitchen and all of them were excellent. However, there were a few standouts that are ""must tries"". One was  the Hamachi Crudo in Passion Fruit, Aji Amarillo, and radishes sauce which tasted very fresh and refreshing. That dish competes with raw fish cuts from the best sushi restaurants in town.  The Brussel Sprouts were also AMAZING and the hanger steak with truffle vinaigrette was medium done perfection. Other standouts were the chicken croquetas and patatas braves. 

We ended the night with dessert. We had the Churros and the Panna cotta with two tawny port pairings. The churros were a little bit doughy for my taste but the Panna Cotta was to die for. If you can do a chef's wine pairing with your meal I highly recommend it. 

This time around the Service was one of the best we've had in D.C., the food was top notch and the tasting menu was well worth it. If it's your first time in Barcelona go with the tasting menu, it won't disappoint you!!!

Thank you Nicole, you are definitely a great asset to Barcelona's team and made our night a great one. This is definitely one great wine bar.

The Food:
Every bite was delicious. We ordered everything...the corn with tarragon butter, manchego and drunken goat cheese, heirloom tomato salad, chicken+jamon croquettas, olives, albondigas, and more. You have to try the hangar steak with truffle vinaigrette and the blistered shishito peppers with olive oil and sea salt. And the bread...oh the bread. Freshly baked, pulls apart perfectly, and just warm enough to dip in olive oil. Overall, great plates for sharing and sampling.

Best I've had in a while. We were a large group of 9, and they managed all of our needs really well. Warm, friendly, and attentive.

From the bar we could see the parade go by and after waiting for around 20-25 minutes we were seated outside and still had the pleasure of watching the parade, it was pretty perfect! 

We ordered gambas, the chickpea spinach dish, and seared tuna, my partner ordered speck, and Mancheho cheese to try as well. I ordered a second glass of sangria because with the energy of the parade and the perfection of the patio it just seemed like a two drink kinda lunch. Our waiter was super friendly, but I can't remember his name. The bread they served was incredibly good and still warm, the olive oil served alongside was also great. We ended up going through two baskets of bread because it was so good paired with the warm chickpeas and gambas sauce.

Luckily, arriving with just one friend at about 845pm on a Thursday night was late enough to score a table with almost no wait time. (If we had opted to wait for patio seating, I imagine there would have been a longer wait.)

The service was wonderful, really a stand out. Our server was extremely helpful pointing out the vegan and vegetarian options and was knowledgeable about the dishes. We were expecting to not have all that many options, but in fact we ended up completely stuffed by the end of the night. We especially enjoyed the eggplant caponata (lovely blend of sweet and spicy) and the chick pea and spinach casoulet (nice savory counterbalance to the eggplant dish), both of which went well with their fresh, hot bread.

We barely had room to try the vegetable paella, but boy was it a beauty. Maybe I'm a sucker for fiddleheads. Very large serving for two, definitely worth a try although it's on the pricey side.

The server also helped me select a Spanish red wine from their exhaustive wine list. Definitely a place to try something new.

Finally had a chance to check out what the hype was all about, and Barcelona did not disappoint.  The food is what drew me here as I'd heard amazing things about their charcuterie selection, as well as their various small bites, and I must say - I'm impressed.  It had all the best parts of Barcelona (delicious food & wine, trendy ambiance, beautiful people) without the not so good parts (terrible service & odd closing hours for siestas).  The servers, the host, and the manager were all downright charming - checking on each table multiple times.  The restaurant itself is well decorated, happening and clean.  The weather was beautiful, so the patio was open and filled to the brim.  Everyone looked like they were having a great time.  I'm obsessed with the steak tartare (must try) and lamb chops.  

In short, Barcelona is definitely worth trying.  They prefer walk ins to reservations, and since it gets crowded very fast, I would recommend going on a Sunday (we had no wait at all!), or before 6 pm on weekdays to beat the happy hour crowds.

This post is more about the service than the food, because that was was truly memorable, for better (on the second trip) or for worse (on the first).

I went to Barcelona this winter with friends and had a horrible experience - we ordered the veggie paella, and over the course of 45 minutes were told that the kitchen was working on it. After nearly an hour, our waiter tells us that - oops! - they forgot to put the paella order in, but that's OK because we can use the money we saved to get more drinks. We were livid - after all, we'd come for dinner. We left a note on the comment card on the way out, and the manager took note. She was horrified, comped our meal, gave us tokens for free drinks, and invited us to come back at a later date.

A couple months later we took her up on the offer. We were seated outside on a lovely night, at a table closest to the sidewalk. The staff was wonderful (it seemed like they were all aware of the terrible first experience we'd had at Barcelona).

We'd had a few plates brought out when we heard a thud behind my friend. Someone walking down 14th Street had grabbed her purse off the side of the booth and fled. Just like that. The outside staff and manager (Johnny, I think his name was) scrambled around with flashlights looking for it, in case it had been dropped under a bench or table, but no dice. They then called a cop who came to take a statement from my friend. The whole time, the staff was incredibly kind and courteous. They again comped our meal, but kept bringing us out more food. All of it was incredible - especially the fiddlehead ferns.

Despite the rocky start, I'd recommend Barcelona in a heartbeat. The staff there is incredible and dedicated to giving customers a great dining experience. Thanks for taking such good care of us, Barcelona!

This is a culinary adventure to be experienced by all! First of all, the staff here is amazingly friendly and epitomizes southern hospitality.

Upon my return visit on a Friday evening, I was greeted by Patrick, who made sure that we were taken care of; I really appreciate that he even took the time to speak with me. Since I did come on a Friday evening, it was PACKED, so much so that it took 30 minutes for us to be seated, even with a reservation. I won't hold that against them though, because there really was a lot of people and I could tell that the hosts were overwhelmed.

I still am not really impressed by the cocktails, they just taste watered down to me. No matter what I got, it tasted like water. The food was excellent, just as it was last time, although they did change the pork belly, which isn't quite as good as the previous version. The mushrooms with goat cheese were delicious, I definitely recommend those. We also enjoyed the cucumber salad, which served as a great palate cleanser. The two cheeses that we got were good as well: Romao (rosemary sheep's milk cheese) and Montbru (buffalo's milk cheese); I also appreciated that the cheese came with some interesting fruits on the side, but I would still prefer crackers over bread). We also got the duck sausage which was good as well. The stand out of the evening, however, was the grilled swordfish. That swordfish blew me away, it was so delicious! It was just the right size too, since swordfish is a thicker, denser fish. I would come back just for the swordfish.

To end the meal, we were served two different desserts: the Chocolate Hazelnut Indulgence, which is a warm, flourless chocolate cake, served with ice cream and the Crepes with dulce de leche. Both dessert were good, but I really loved the Chocolate Hazelnut Indulgence. We also enjoyed these with wines, which were Tempranillos; unfortunately they ran out of my favorite red wine, Malbec.

972,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=d_RWrxa7ocRoPYyY-Ttn7A,"BARCELONA IS IN DC!!! I am SOOO excited that it is here. I have a lot of history with Barcelona in West Hartford, CT. Having recently moved here with a couple of friends from CT, we were all bummed about leaving the wonderful Barcelona behind us and to never taste its mind blowing brussel sprouts again. But as the stars would have it, Barcelona couldn't bare leaving us behind either so it decided to open a new location in DC so now we can all go back for their brussel sprouts and yummy wines once again.

Atmosphere: Very hip and classy. It's the hot new place in town so it is ALWAYS crowded. It's funny because the manager, Emily, mentioned that if you want to come sit at the bar without a wait, go at 3:30 PM.... Haha. But yes, very crowded and happy place. You can sit at the bar, stand by the bar, sit at the 4-person tables by the bar, or sit in the dining room in the towards the back of the bar. (Lots of cozy seating options outside as well with wooden tables and chairs but probably not a good idea for winter time.) Barcelona is dimly lit so it always has a chill, intimate vibe to it. 

Food:
BRUSSEL SPROUTS ALL THE WAY (sorry other DC favs, Barcelona has the best sprouts, hands down). Sorry, I get excited about them. I actually hate brussel sprouts anywhere else but Barcelona's are just to die for. We can eat them by the pound.
Flank Steak-another favorite. The texture is so buttery and so melt in your mouth delicious.
Warm Chocolate Hazelnut cake-it's warm and gooey on the inside, so chocolatey. Topped with a coconut ice cream that is just perfect for it. 
Crepas-this was a bit too sweet for me. The dulce de leche was yummy but the cream inside just kind of put it over the top. 
Suckling pig croquettes-yummy! You get 3 with a sauce on the bottom. 
Bread-complimentary. Freshly made. Warm and soft and omg amazing. Comes with olive oil. We usually end up asking for constant refills.... 
So Barcelona is all about tapas so you end up ordering a couple to fill you up. Though they do offer large portions for groups of 2 or more on the bottom of their menu like paella, etc. 
Wine: 
Just get anything. Everything is delicious. Ask for recommendations. 

Service:
We fell in love with Andy. He was so attentive, cheerful and friendly. He came by and listened to our history with Barcelona. He also gave us a little something at the end of dinner as a thank you. What a wonderful person. All the other waiters and waitresses that came by were also very friendly and attentive. =D!!
Emily, the manager, also stopped by and chatted us up. She knew our favorite bartender back in CT (Dan, this is a shoutout to you!)! She was awesome and we really appreciated her stopping by to check in. We wish her the best of luck for her hot new business. 

Oh and if you fill out a survey at the end of your meal, you'll get a free drink token! (That's like $8!)

Overall, please go try Barcelona and see why we all fell in love with it. You won't be disappointed!

Barcelona is straight up HOPPIN'. Getting a table here on a weekday night proved a feat. They have an outdoor area with heaters so you can sit outside, inside at a table, or at the bar. It was certainly worth the wait though. Just guzzle some of their delicious cocktails and you will be set.

Let me start off by saying the drinks are awesome. The Bramble Snap and Summer St. Sling were both delicious. The sangria is very juicy so if you're trying to get your buzz on, go for a cocktail.

As for food, the whipped sheep's cheese is a must. It makes a great starter with some bread to dip. The spinach chickpea cazuela and patatas bravas were also tasty. Let me put it this way, everything I tried was awesome. It's hard to even recommend! From one Yelper to another, just follow your heart. Everything had a great, unique flavor profile. It WORKED. And unlike many tapas places in DC, the prices are actually reasonable. 

The service was excellent. You can tell the staff are truly there to make sure you have a great experience. Even though it was crazily crowded, the servers were very attentive and the manager even came over to say hello.

The ambience feels like the inside of Birth and Barley but definitely brighter...clean and chic. And as expected it was already crowded but we went early enough that there were spaces to take a breather....and yes you can do reservations but we waited just as long putting our names with the host.  Ideally they would call your cell since they ask for your phone number but we just asked him politely when we were chilling at the bar for around a 20 minute wait..no biggie.

Unfortunately the ""outside"" tables were prime property but glad we were seated in the covered part of the restaurant which was open to the outside anyways considering their fireplace was blowing smoke all over and I'm sure was not pleasant for those near it.

Menu was definitely full of wonderful tapas and the ones that definitely stuck in my mind was the calamari, goat cheese, and pork belly.  We got the vegetarian paella and although I'm not a vegetarian it was still definitely delicious.

They initially actually got us the meat loaded paella and when we clarified that we wanted the vegetarian one our waiter was very apologetic and the cute manager in the white necktie with a big knot came by to also apologize for the mix-up and even sent us around 3 extra tapas to make up for the confusion...how nice is that! And once we got our paella the wait was worth it and we didn't mind cause we were there to enjoy company anyways.

I'd definitely come back again and I would say I'd come back when the hype calms down but I doubt that it's popularity is going to fade anytime soon...so yes definitely a must-do now if you're in DC.

I went with a group of 8 and had a reservation.  I got there first.  The hostess seated me even though the rest of the party wasn't there and was delightful on top of it.  Some people ended up being very late, but we got no guff.  A few of us mentioned dietary restrictions so our waiter wrote all over a copy of the menu to indicate what had what in it.  The ambiance was great - really modern, a kind of rustic contemporary vibe, and posh, but still comfortable.  Very well thought out.

I don't even think it was that expensive.  It's possible to eat at a variety of price points if you pay attention.  Skipping alcohol would also save tremendous amounts of money.  But you can easily eat for under $30 there with tax and tip and still get a decent, filling meal.  This same group and I went to Barrel in Eastern Market last month, which Yelp says is only $$ while Bacelona is listed as $$$, and Barrel was way more expensive because the portions were deceptively small for the price points we were charged.  Same problem at Cork - you're paying entree level prices for small plates that are barely more than a nibble.  Here, for tapas small plates, the portions were actually quite ample.  And all the food was really really good.  There wasn't a single thing that made anyone say ""meh.""

We had a sangria with lavender and sage in it that was incredible.  The deserts were all just as good as the food, which is pretty unusual, meal timing was great.  We got a few paellas - personally of everything that's the one thing I could have skipped, just because I find paella kind of boring and thought the tapas was more interesting and I would have liked to try more.  Good sherry selection.  We all left stuffed and satisfied.

When it came to split the check up - we ended up doing 5 separate bills - the waiter was super accommodating, too.  And the staff knew the menu so questions were promptly answered.

If I was going to make a complaint it would be that the round table we were at was too small for 8, and the chairs were kind of uncomfortable, especially because we were crammed in.  But on the other hand it made it easier to hear each other and pass dishes.

For tapas we shared the tortilla, croquetas, and mushrooms. Tortilla was delicious with just the right amount of eggy goodness.

One of my best friends was visiting from NJ. I live a few blocks from Barcelona and had been hearing rave reviews about it from friends who are DC natives so we decided to check it out. My big mistake was not making a reservation. We got there and were told we had over an hour wait. But my friend was visiting and I wanted to show her a good time so we decided to wait. Three of us hung around the bar, got a drink, and one of the waitresses asked us if we wanted chairs. so she went and got us chairs and made a makeshift bar table for us. Seriously, the sweetest, most thoughtful waitress ever. So we waited about an hour and this woman at a table got up and I asked her if we could take her table. She says sure, gets up, and my friends and I sit down. As soon as I sit down, this crazy girl comes yelling at us about how she's been waiting with her friends. AND SHE GRABS THE STOOL out from under my friend's behind. Not cool. This turns into a huge ordeal, and we decide to leave the table bc honestly, there are more important things in life. So we go back to our makeshift table and the waitress comes over and profusely apologizes. Then, the manager comes over and apologizes again. And he buys us all a round of drinks. 

two things. 1. best customer service EVER. Seriously. They have plenty of customers to have to worry about losing business. but they're not about business. they're about people. 2. best drink ever. seriously. some whiskey something but it was awesome.

I'll keep it short and simple: Order a glass of Malbec, the cheese plate, and patatas bravas and then realize you can now die happy. 

The whole scoop: The service is so, so depending on which day you go. From what I can see I think servers usually have more tables than hands so you do have to call them over usually when you want something. But everything else is just perfect, the ambiance, the food, the drinks. It's one of my favorite places to enjoy a nice meal after a long week.

knowing full well that Barcelona is popular we opted to go at 8pm on a Sunday.  To our amazement there was still about a 45 minute wait.  We didn't have much to do so we told the hostess we'd gladly wait.  Luckily, the bar is spacious and accommodating.  Love the selection of bottled beers and looking forward to some locals rotating through on draft.  The beauty of Barcelona is you can swing through for a drink and order a few tapas at the bar; we'll definitely keep that in mind for future weekends.  

When we were called to our table we could not have been happier.  The table was amazing... I would say one of the best in the house.  We sat outside under the heat lamps right next to the fire.  I love the stone accents and bench seating.  Also, the provided fleece blankets put Barcelona on par with some of the best rooftop bars in New York- the feel out there is just lovely.  

As soon as we sat down the General Manager, Patrick swung by to stoke the fire and make sure everything was alright.  He made a few cheese recommendations and helped us select the highlight of our evening- our 2008 bottle of Cerro Anon Reserva.  With the help of our server Chelsea (I believe) we ordered chorizo picate, drunken goat cheese, romao cheese.  

The cheese and sausage were to die for.  We were so excited to order the drunken goat (It appeared in nearly every review we read prior to going) but surprisingly our favorite was the romao cheese.  As we ate we ordered more tapas: the hanger steak, spiced beef empanadas, cucumber salad, and crispy brussels sprouts.  The hanger steak was out of this world.  I'm pretty sure i'm going to have dreams about that dish for weeks to come.  It was cooked to perfection and the sauce was amazing. 

For dessert we opted to go with a small dish of ice cream and a glass of Pedro Ximénez.  Our server, Chelsea, was so nice and accommodating when we admitted we didn't know what Sherry was- her lesson was very interesting and got us excited to try the glass of Pedro Ximénez.  It was the perfect end to a very exciting Sunday night.  

Our cab drivier summed it up when we jumped in and said- ""this is the best place to pick people up from on the weekend... it's always packed.""  I'm already looking forward to going back- I can taste the hanger steak already!

We started with a cocktail each off of their cocktail list and we both enjoyed the heck out of our choices!  After that we asked for a wine recommendation, and our server called over one of their wine experts.  I'm not sure if he is their sommelier, but his suggestion was spot-on when we asked for a full-bodied red with deep fruit flavors and a hint of spiciness.

I was a little later than my friend getting there, so she took control of our hunger and had already ordered four dishes prior to my arrival, and they started arriving right after we finished our cocktails. I eat a gluten-free diet, which was told to our server.  He asked if there were any other dietary restrictions, and at our polite urging, picked four dishes that he loved, so we treated each dish like (insert holiday) morning as it arrived!

Sampling of the dishes (tapas) we ordered:
Meat & Cheese Plate
Red & Golden Beet Salad
Mixed Spanish Olives
Crispy Calamari -- for my friend b/c not gluten-free
Gambas al Ajillo
Grilled Hanger Steak
Patatas Bravas
Flan Catalan - dessert

They have a great set up with full bar service, an outdoor area with heat lamps and blankets and also an indoor dining area.  It's a very popular destination so calling ahead for reservations is a must.

SCENE:  Wife and I were celebrating her birthday and had a 7:30 reservation time.  We arrived slightly late due to traffic and as a result had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated.  This wasn't a huge inconvenience as we grabbed a few glasses of a spanish red at the bar to hold us over.

DETAILED THOUGHTS:  As soon as we seated we were greeted by the floor manager and 2 servers.  The entire staff seemed very friendly and attentive.  They brought by 2 small plates and bread as starters.  Along with that we had ordered a bottle of 2012 Garnatxa Peluda which was excellent.  We proceeded to order Watermelon Radish Salad, Jamon Serrano, Barcelona mixed grill, and Mussels al Diablo all of which was fantastic.  I'd have to say the Barcelona mixed grill which included steak, pork chop and churizo was the best collection of grilled meat I've had.

We ordered the Spinach Chickpea Cazuela, Button Mushrooms with White Truffle Oil, Roasted Brussel Sprouts, and Olives.

The food is delicious and portioned well.  We did roasted curry cauliflower, beet salad with jicama and fried manchago, spicy beef empanadas, mushrooms with goats cheese, chorizo with sweet and sour fig and spicy caponata.  The bread was crusty and warm the wine was crisp and light.  

We made pigs of ourselves and ordered fried dough with cinnamon sugar and a chili dark chocolate dipping sauce for dessert with cafe con leche and coffee. My Spanish stinks.  There is a name for these and I just had them at a street fair so I apologize for not remembering how to spell (churros).

The place is as crowded and noisy as any place that attracts so many people, but there's a fireplace, more room and less noise on the heated patio.  Parking in that neighborhood is a challenge, but it's an OK area to walk, and there are plenty of taxis.

Efficient fast service - food doesn't come at the same time though, which I think it's on purpose and it's a good thing, so you have time to appreciate the dishes instead of having a table full of food.

Downside: Sangria was good but a little bit too sweet for me. Hanger steak wasn't as good as the other tapas - Didn't enjoy the churros or the dipping sauce that comes with it - I think it tastes like chocolate milk from the grocery store, instead of dark chocolate as it says.

We had been here before and while we loved the wine and the tapas, we had been a little disappointed by the paella. This time, though, the paella would not disappoint. It takes about 30 minutes to prepare but that's how things are done in Spain so the best thing to do is order some tapas and full pitcher of their delicious sangria and think to yourself 'Welcome to Spain'.
If you go for the paella, order the traditional seafood option. The paella easily feeds two and when it comes, make sure to really work your spoon down to the cast iron to scrape up the burnt parts that stick to the bottom of the pan, that's the really good stuff. 
The paella comes loaded with clams, mussels, squid, and three big gambas. The rice is richly colored with saffron and packs a lot of flavor. We loved every ounce of the paella and will be back for more soon. 

(!!) If you're deciding on what tapas to order, order the lightly smoked fresh Pulpo (octopus). It comes in a rich cold marinade of oil, vinegar, lemon. Little beads of fat and oil blend in with the delicious juice and I stopped short of asking for another one. We did ask for more bread for the table to soak it all up, though.

The food was wonderful, tapas plates were well-portioned, reasonably priced, and came out very quickly. Meat and cheese platters were delicious, especially the Jambon and Aged Mahon. Great place if you're into goat cheese. Fairly wide selection of wines. And if you're not into small plates, you can get bigger orders for the table.

I came here yesterday 9-10-14 it was my birthday and my boyfriend bought me here and wow did he out do himself.

From the restaurant  manager, our waiter Kyle K. 

We were given two compliment glasses of champagne. 

We had the calamari, spiced beef empanadas, the steak, lamb chops, and chicken pimientos as well as the churro a and dulce de leche

The calamari was absolutely so fresh and delicious. *Not chewy at all* more flaky and light. YUMMMM

The spiced beef empanadas were the best empanadas I've had by far, nice crunchy and light, the beef was just mouth watering with the sauce.

The steak..... Just so you know that is how a steak should be cooked and made. So much flavor and just reminds me that not a lot of restaurants I've been too make good steak. The sauce that was drizzled on top went absolutely so well with the steak. 

I've never at lamb before but this was another score. With the side salad with a delicious dressing/ vinaigrette. 


Last but not least the chicken pimientos. OMG OMG OMG...
The fried thin slices of potatoes with jalapeños mixed in with this broth/sauce not too spicy but spicy enough where you got a good kick when eating everything and dipping all in one bite.

The churros were so yummy, so soft and flaky and the dark chocalate that was melted to dip in was so rich.

We were instantly told that it'd be an hour wait. No biggie, as we weren't that hungry anyway. So, they took our number, and we rolled to blackjack for a quick drink. About 45 minutes later, I got a call that our table was ready. We received great service during our visit, and the waiter was very helpful in explaining many of the menu options to the girlfriend.

First, had a wonderful experience at the Bar with Roberto.  He was on top of every water and drink order.  This made my client happy which also made me happy.  He was also very friendly and polite.

Recently went back in for a dinner.  Nicole Q was awesome in getting us a great table and keeping us updated on when it would be ready.  She's a great asset to the company.  The service that followed was also impeccable. In particular I want to commend Randy (mgr), Dani (server), and the house sommelier. 

 Highlights on the food - Chorizo and Figs (always a winner), hangar steak (classic), iberica ham (when in Spain or Barcelona,D.C.), bib salad with goat cheese....out of the desserts - the churros dish is wild.  The dipping sauce has a real kick to it and offers a unique dessert experience.  For a more traditional rich choice try the crepes with vanilla ice cream.

I have been here a countless number of times and enjoyed outstanding food, drinks, the atmosphere and service on every occasion. Super sexy vibe, due in part to both the place and the people. Make sure your style game is strong and dress well! The hostess is wonderful and will always make sure to treat you right especially if you made a reservation and they are running late in having your table ready. I also really like the voucher coin feature that they have just for filling out a survey. Definitely make sure to fill one out because the coin can be redeemed for a free drink or tapas dish the next time you return! 

My favorite favorite dish here is that amazing melted garlic spinach and chickpea cazuela! I would always get one for myself alone. I had no intentions of sharing! I have had the patatas bravas, the mahi (so good!), the shrimp (i forget which one but it was very delicious) and a few others that I cannot remember. My boyfriend would always get the albondigas and I have been on dates with my girlfriends and they raved about the hanger steak. I have taken my parents and family here as well on several occasions. Whenever my parents are in town, I always suggest perhaps trying a new restaurant, change it up a bit, but because Barcelona is just THAT good, they don't want to go anywhere else! On a side note, my boyfriend and I would always get a pitcher of white sangria. I think for $23 you get something like 8 glasses out of it, all to ourselves! Yes, we left rather intoxicated but we left incredibly satisfied! The yummy bread definitely helped to soak up some of the booze ;)

I have not yet been to brunch but I have no doubt that it's as wonderful as their dinner menu. I also have not yet sat outside despite having been there several times. One day, I WILL sit outside! One day...

One piece of advice, definitely make reservations! We have been a few times where we just walked in without a res and had to wait anywhere from 1-2 hours, which for us was not a problem, as we would just go get drinks somewhere else on U-street to pass the time until we got a call from Barcelona telling us our table was ready.

Temperature, noise level, lighting, music, and very professional service - everything was just perfect. We stayed almost 2 hours just talking and eating, and had a great time.

All our dishes were surprisingly excellent; really the only average one was the patatas bravas (the brava sauce was not the best I've ever had). The chorizo and figs was insanely delicious. The beets were great too. We did not partake in any of the cheese plates or larger meat entrees, but the smaller tapas were very satisfying and portions were generous compared to competitors. A pitcher of red sangria is $23 and it tasted just the tiniest bit watered down, but was still decent. The prices overall were very reasonable, and while our meal was probably on the lighter side relative to other diners, our bill ended up being about $25 a head, which is pretty good for a very satisfying meal in DC.

This month's issue of Washingtonian has their food critic bashing Barcelona, touting Estadio and Jaleo as far superior.

It definitely didn't disappoint and all expectations were exceeded. 

This is my favorite new spot that has opened in the last year or two on 14th st, and THAT is saying something as one great new restaurant/bar has opened after the next. The only issue that I could say is that it is too popular right now, which is hardly a knock or fair. 

The layout & design of the place is what first strikes you...it's beautiful & sets the tone for a great ambiance. You walk up to an awesome patio (which is going to kill this area when the weather gets nice) with an outdoor fireplace. Inside has nice art & beautiful dark wood everywhere with high ceilings. It's a tapas menu, which i like as i get to try a lot of different flavors. Everything was delicious from the meat/cheese plate to the shrimp to the brussel sprouts, pork chop & hanger steak. We also had the sangria & was pleased to find a cocktail menu with a Caipirinha on it, which i fell in love with traveling down in Brazil. It's hard to find a good one in this area, but that was pretty decent. 

Overall, just a really cool/hip place with great food & great service (multiple servers will help you throughout the meal).

I recommend the spinach-chickpea cazuela (spinach and chickpeas with herbs and cumin), jamon + chicken croquettes (ham and chicken), roasted beets, and the albondigas (meatballs on the spicy side). Every time I visit, I try different tapas as the menu is extensive. The dessert menu is lacking a bit. I yearn for more variety and interesting twists on things. I tried two desserts and they were both only OK, so I would recommend just having an extra cocktail, cava, or glass of wine for dessert.

They tend to have 3 different choices of cava for by-the-glass pours. Their selection is great if you'd like to share a bottle. Same goes with wine. Cava is really Barcelona's (the actual city) spin on champagne/sparkling wine. It's bubbly, refreshing, and delicious. My favorite cocktail here is The Avation. Slightly sweet, but refreshing (I love refreshing things if you haven't noticed) drink that resembles a blue Gatorade. I had one, and other people at the bar were like ""Ohhh...I'll have one, too"" and within 10 mins, 3 people at the bar were enjoying this awesome drink. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, no?

The service is impeccable. I've only sat at the bar (don't really want to start bringing people here until they accept reservations because who wants to wait 2 hrs to eat?). The bartenders are talented, attentive, and very friendly. I've asked some bartenders to make drinks that aren't on the menu, and they happily obliged (with each one knowing exactly the ingredients to each cocktail). Fingers crossed that the great service keeps up and not only because Barcelona's been open for a few months.

Like I mentioned above, this place is always crowded. If you're going to the bar, prepare to fight for seats and hover over people. I've seen a weird situation where there was a line behind the bar patrons and then another line right behind that line! Pretty intense. Eventually, you'll be seated, though. When it comes to dining at a table, check out the remaining reviews but it's usually a couple of hours or so. I recommend dining a bit early and arriving right when they open (or a bit before) to get seated quickly. Here's to hoping they start accepting reservations in the near future.

Enough said - give Barcelona a try and make sure to come early if you're hungry!

1203,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=ZNwuaHiQ0b-lb4hQMB9Nnw,"This restaurant serves Tapas and Spanish style food on 14th Street.

The service at this place is impeccable. While waiting in the bar, there were so many servers and bussers going past and instead of making you feel like they were in their way, they made you feel like they were in your way. The bartenders actively make eye contact with the patrons, instead of you fighting to get their attention. And, in case you didn't know, this place is packed to the brim nightly.

I came tonight, on a cold DC Thursday expecting the absolute worst. I've walked in and walked out because I was told there was a 2 hour wait. They don't do many reservations, and I actually don't know their rules for doing them.

We were told 1 hour and it ended up being close to 1 hour and 30 minutes. When I went up as the annoying guest asking ""are we there yet?"" they took the time to tell me why it was taking longer and then let us know an updated time, which was fairly accurate. We were seated by a vivacious and energetic hostess that had been dealing with impatient and likely rude guests all evening, and she never broke her smile the whole night.

I came with 7+ a high chair for a 21 month old. We were placed at a cozy table and I'll tell the truth, we told them 6, and added one at last minute. We were those people. They added a chair and we got very close. Waters delivered immediately, two waiters introduced themselves, and took drink orders. They also told us that specific dishes took a long time (paella and grilled meat platters), which got us to put those in first. We ordered 2 patatas bravas, 2 asparagus with aioli, seafood paella, a churrasco, multiple hamachi crudos, gambas ajillo, 2 tortillas, blood sausage, 2 chorizo with fig, scallops, lamb chops, 2 lamb burgers, 2 beef empanadas.. I think that's all of it.

The pacing was impeccable. Rarely were we overburdened. Service was slowed down when it needed to be, but with attention to whether we needed more drinks. The food quality was high - highlights included lamb chops, churrasco, chorizo, hamachi crudo... Paella was not like Barcelona the city, but tasty in it's own right. Not one dish was bad. I never order patatas bravas because stateside it's essentially French fries and hot sauce, but here the fiery tomato sauce and aioli made it impressive.

I can't really get thinking about the food, even though it was fabulous, I'm just so impressed at the way the restaurant presented itself. A prince amongst men...

I hated the idea of this place - a Connecticut chain, the hottest gals and guys in DC, a hostess that could be a model, a fancy bar and terribly long wait times. But, sometimes the execution and the effort overstate any potential negatives.

If the food gets any better and the service stays the same, this place will last a long time. And, final caveat - I freaking hate tapas state side.

I went here with 4 friends for dinner after work around 630 and didn't have to wait at all! We considered sitting outside since there are heat lamps and blankets (!!!) at every table & chair, but decided to check out the inside.  It has a very industrial feel that reminded us of NYC.  Thumbs up for the atmosphere!

We ordered a pitcher of half white & half red sangria per the server's recommendation and it was delicious! Pears, apples, and enough drink for all 6 of us to have 2 glasses each.  Each of us also tried different cocktails (listed by preference): Hot Dahlia (spicy jalepeno & tequila!) Aye Cukarumba (refreshing cucumber and habanero bitters), Bramble Snap (sweet blackberries, ginger, vermouth and mint), Summer St. Sling (smooth vodka and grapefruit)

We split the following tapas, again listed by preference:

Meat & Cheese plate: Jamon Serrano and Chorizo de Soria with the Manchego  and San Simon cheese
Albondigas: 7 tender meatballs with sweet tomato sauce...a must have!
Chorizo + Sweet-Sour Figs: Plump figs and thick chorizo in an amazing sauce.  We kept the plate after everything was gone just to dip our bread!
Button Mushrooms & Truffle Oil: 'nuff said.  Gotta have it!
Jamon + Chicken Croquettes: 4 grilled 'balls' ... crunchy and not oily at all.  Very good!
Spicy Eggplant Caponata: Served 'room termperature' .. sweet and savory
Spiced Beef Empanadas: lightly friend empandas with a spicy red pepper sauce.  very good, but if you'r egoing to have something friend I would recommen the croquettes
Mixed Spanish Olives: Lots of green olives (don't think they were mixed now that I think about it ...) good, but only order if you are an olive lover!

The only thing that was somewhat weird to me was how the servers and busboys hovered over us.  It was hard to feel entirely relaxed because there were never more than an earshot away, and the main server was actively training a new hire at our table which was a bit weird.

Last night a group of friends went for drinks and tapas. Despite the restaurant and bar being PACKED, it was so much fun. Where do I even begin with all the things I loved.

First, the staff was awesome. The host was friendly, the bartender was super sweet, our server was helpful, and all the bussers were on point. One of the managers was going to each table to say hello and welcome guests--nice touch for a new place. I was impressed that despite the place being packed, we were never waiting too long for a drink, refill on water, bread, food, plates, etc. The staff managed to be attentive despite how busy they were, and did it with a great attitude.

Next, I loved the atmosphere. It's a pretty dressy/after work spot. Lots of men in suits, ladies in heels, etc. There were a few wildcard casual looks but for the most part very upscale. It's loud and bustling (and HOT! Inside and out it is hot, that would probably be my only complaint of the night) There's a spacious inside dining area, a large bar section with first come, first served tables, and a beautiful outdoor deck with fireplace. I would have loved to sit outside but the wait was pretty long--next time!

We tried a few cocktails. I had a glass of white sangria and we all split a pitcher of red. The red sangria tasted a little bit like fruit punch mixed with wine--but in a good way. The white was refreshing and sweet. My favorite drink was the Brookline Sour--their twist on a whiskey sour, yum.  

Now for the most important thing--FEWD. First, I loved EVERYTHING we tried. We started with crusty, warm bread and olive oil (which they kept coming throughout the meal!) Next, we had ham and chicken croquettes. They were superb, fried to perfection, and rich. We shared the whipped sheep's milk cheese with bread, which was quickly devoured by the table. The cod fritters were also fried to perfection and had a nice sauce. The calamari came with the most tasty sauce ever and was enough for five ladies to share. The patatas bravas were done very well and came out piping hot. The spinach chickpea cazuela was interesting - it had an Indian/middle eastern flavor. Basically, we had a tough time picking what to get, because everything looked great. Other items that looked great were empanadas and octopus. 

OK, and craziest part of this whole night--it was cheap. As in, I paid more for a lunch from UNO'S (ICK!!) earlier in the day than I did for this bomb-ass meal. Easy five star review--keep it up Barcelona !!

A group of friends and I went to Barcelona Saturday night for dinner. When the first of our group arrived at 7:00 we were told that it would be an hour and a half wait. We decided to wait because we had nothing else going on that night and we were very excited to try this restaurant. We all got some drinks at the bar (which was packed) and began waiting. So 8:30 comes and goes, and that is when we start asking the host stand about every two seconds when we will finally be sat. Eventually, at a little after 9 we finally get a table outside on the patio (thankfully there were plenty of heat lamps and they provide blankets to put over your lap!). 

Once we had our table, the manager came over an apologized for how long we had to wait and our server informed us that we would get a few dishes as a started on the house. They brought us olives, olive tapenade, and the whipped sheeps cheese. So we each ordered around 2-3 dishes and munched on the provided snacks while we waited for everything else to come out. I have to say that the food was excellent! My favorite dishes had to have been the grilled hangar steak with black truffle vinaigrette, the migas del momento (chorizo and with a fried egg on top), and the albondegas, and the gambas al ajillo.

The service was WONDERFUL. Our waitress, Kate, was in town from another Barcelona location in New Haven...it will be so sad to see her go because she was fantastic. She was happy to provide suggestions on the menu and to suggest great wines that would go well with the food that we had ordered and our personal tastes. Also, the manager was very attentive and was constantly walking around the entire restaurant and checking up on tables as much as possible. 

There was one final mishap, but once again the manager and service handled it wonderfully. One of the dishes we ordered had been forgotten and it finally came out after we reminded someone 40 minutes after we had ordered. The server came by and apologized and when we got the bill she said that they had comped most of our tapas for us waiting so long and for the extra mistake. And when she said most of our tapas, I think we had about 3 left on the bill and then the drinks we had ordered!!! We were stunned at how much they had taken off and thanked them repeatedly saying that it was too much. All in all, the food is wonderful, the service is beyond excellent, and I would say that it was definitely worth the long wait that evening.

We got the sangria because...well I don't need to explain why someone would order sangria. The pitchers are very reasonable. I didn't find them to be particularly strong,  but the pitcher is big and seems bottomless (you think it's almost done, but there are like 3.5 good glasses left in there!).

The food was delicious. The stand outs were:

There isn't a better tapas place in DC. The Mariscos (seafood) paellas was the best dish with prawns, squid, clams, and mussels. We tried the Parillada which was a HUGE portion of all the cooked meats - NY strip, chicken, pork chops, and sausage. If you're really hungry, order this. Otherwise I recommend sticking to tapas. I've been craving shishito peppers since we had them in Barcelona, and the ones here came close to the real thing. My all time favorite in Spanish tapas is the iberico ham - highly recommend this with wine and cheese. We loved the beef tartare, and hanger steak. And the red wine sangrias really delicious!

The ambience and location is great. It's just around the corner from U Street so you can plan your weekend here. The bar, outdoor patio seating, and indoor seating has a fun and lively ambience. 

The service is a little spotty. The first time we came we got a free pitcher of sangria for having to wait when it was my birthday. The second time we got seated right away. But 8 of us were seated on what should have been a 5 person table so it's tight on seating, and with all the tapas it was a challenge to fit everything on the table. The waitress seemed frazzled, and in a hurry to get us ordering and out. The restaurant was really uncomfortably warm/hot inside. We asked several times if they could turn up the AC but it didn't seem to change the room temperature. So hopefully that was just a one time incident.

1282,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=0ltgWEg8_n8BMmul-ETa4Q,"Update: I'm changing my review from 1 star to 5 stars. After I wrote my 1 star review, Alex the owner immediately reached out to me and apologized for my awful experience. It felt sincere and he encouraged me to come back, which my boyfriend and I did last Saturday. When we walked in we noticed that the hostess area felt a lot less chaotic with plenty of space for people to walk around. This felt more welcoming than our previous experience.

Now, since we finally got to sit down and try their food I have to say that everything was quality. Both my boyfriend and I felt that this was the best meal we have had. The stand out dishes were the Jamon Mangalica, sliced perfectly thin, which made the fat and cured meat combination melt in your mouth; the croquettes, which were so flavorful, filled with ham and cheese; the whipped sheep's cheese, topped with pistachios and paprika and satisfied the creamy, dip-like cheese texture I love; the smoked bluefish pate that wasn't overpowering in saltiness (try spreading the pate on bread and topping it with the whipped sheep's cheese - it may be tapas blasphemy but it is an amazing combination!); the gambas al ajillo which were cooked perfectly with thinly sliced cloves of garlic; and the grilled lamb chops which also could not have been cooked better with a wonderful grilled flavor. We also had the braised short ribs which I did not like, but my boyfriend loved. That's not Barcelona's fault, I have never been a fan of braised short ribs. 

For dessert we ordered the warm hazelnut indulgence and churros y chocolate. The hazelnut indulgence was incredible. It was dense with rich hazelnut and chocolate flavor and topped with vanilla ice cream and garnished with a berry sauce. I liked the churros, which were not overly sweet,which is a good thing, and very flaky. I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate, but my boyfriend is so he enjoyed the dip for the churros. 

As for the drinks, I had the Bees Wings which was light and floral, very tasty. My boyfriend was introduced to his new favorite drink: the Bourbon Spice Rack. He has been remaking this cocktail at home almost every night this week and credits Barcelona for giving him a new go to cocktail.

We had made reservations for 5 pm but there were several tables open in the bar area and a nice array of happy hour offerings was in effect till 6 pm so we opted to sit in the bar area. We started with the patatas, eggplant caponata and croquettes. All very good, and VERY well priced for h-hour. We later had the meatball, chorizo and fig and churros. 

The bar area (and possibly the whole restaurant) operates with team service meaning that you have multiple waiters checking to see if you want/need anything, re-filling water glasses, recommending wine, clearing plates etc... Not in an annoying, are you trying to rush us, stop interrupting us way, but in a we never have to wait for drinks/food or wait to find our waiter if we need anything sort of way. Our two main guys were DeShawn and Jose, and we adored them. Fun but professional and without being overbearing. We had a weird wobbly table that they set to fixing immediately. It meant they had to clear our table top of everything (and moments before our food arrived) which was a bummer but they quickly found another spot for us while we waited for them to fix the table. 

A few notes: the bread is fluffy and crusty and perfect for dipping in oil. The sangria is VERY weak... tasty, but weak. If you like a stronger drink, you might want to skip this. Consistent with the great service we were getting all night, we told a manager about this and he bought over a few ""floaters"" to add to the sangria- on the house. Nice!

Overall, a very cool place... excellent service, great happy hour specials. Oh, and if you're like me and always on the hunt for a jalapeño infused drink, try the hot dahlia!

I get weird about  tapas in the United States because you rarely ever get satiated and you drop an enormous amount of money.  This was not the case at Barcelona.  Not to say that it's low on price points, you come away incredibly satisfied.  The food was absolutely superb ... every single morsel.  I can't remember a time when i was served a piece of chicken and I had to keep eating even after I was already full.  We ordered two tapas: brussel sprouts with chorizo and calamari.  I always like to say that how a restaurant treats calamari is a good test to how skilled the kitchen staff is - Barcelona did a phenomenal job with each.  Crispy and incredibly flavorful, a touch of the aeoli was just enough to accentuate the flavor. But then we ordered the mixed grill called the ""Barcelona"" which is a paleo eaters dream:  A butcher block full of meat and every single piece of meat (chicken, steak, sausage, pork) was truly amazing.  I'm not a glutton but I could NOT stop eating all of it.  I pulled some skin off the chicken piece and set it aside but after taking a nibble from it, I just kept eating it.  I have never had such a perfectly seasoned piece of chicken.  
I really love this place and is now my favorite. 

The service was great but it was also a Sunday night (5PM) after the holiday season.

Barcelona appears to be a very popular place, since it was packed to the rafters on a Tuesday night (though it was Canada Day, so perhaps they were all Canadians??). The food was without exception excellent, from the platter of three Spanish cured meats (finocchiona, fuet and salchicon de Vic) to the delectable cazuela of spinach and chickpeas, and the perfectly cooked branzino (which is misspelled on the menu). The wine list is very extensive, with a dizzying array of Spanish wines, few of which were familiar to me, but our waiter was able to steer us toward one that we enjoyed very much and that complemented the meal perfectly.

1373,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=DHZiczt6eA4NvDSYTfLo-w,"I'm going to preface this by saying my experience at Barcelona was not actually perfect. We went to brunch yesterday around 2 PM and the place was packed. Our waitress seemed a little overwhelmed and was not very fast -- definitely don't come here on the weekend if you're in a hurry, is the impression I have -- but she was knowledgeable about the menu and very chatty (in a good way). The food was GREAT. My lamb burger was a little overdone, but still delicious. I got a nice veggie stir-fry on the side instead of fries. My friend's ricotta pancakes were awesome. Definitely go for some meat and cheese with your meal, too -- the jamon here is wonderful. The drinks were about average, although their Albarino white wine is nice.

Here's where the real story begins: I ate half my burger (and all the veggies) and asked the other half to be wrapped up. While we waited, we filled out the comment card, which got us a free wine token (so, you know, do this). And then we waited. And waited... and then, just as I was starting to ask our waitress what had happened, the manager (I think) slid up and gave us another free wine token. ""For the burger,"" he explained apologetically. They threw out the other half!

Now, the value of the wine token is about the same as half a burger based on their menu, so I was disappointed, but ready to take my wine and go. Here's where I was impressed, though: the waitress immediately offered to have the kitchen make a new burger with another veggie side for me to take home for free. We had our free wine while we waited. I actually told the waitress I really only needed the burger, but they ended up giving me a side of (very tasty) fries, too. I had the burger for dinner and it was perfectly cooked this time.

Obviously, a perfect meal would have been best, but mistakes happen. What impressed me most about Barcelona was the impeccable way they handled the issue. So many restaurants have rude, crummy service -- a place that can screw up and still make me walk away very happy gets a huge number of points in my book. I will definitely return to Barcelona.

Even with the attitude stacked against Barcelona and a 45 minute wait at an overcrowded bar--yes, five stars.

Firstly, the small selection of affordable craft beers-- including some local favs--was a smart move on Barcelona's part.  This isn't the case for some other spots on 14th, that only offer pricey imports on the beer list.  

The sangria was good and potent-- on another occasion a friend and I split a 24$$ pitcher of sangria and we both got drunk. So there's that.

Food:  The satueed spinach is more like a dip that a side.  With the warm bread and olive oil, the spinach was delicious and filling.

You know those sorts where the girls are all a teeny size zero and the men have perfect posture and pecs. And everyone is just hanging out there, with no care in the world. 

If you can brave through the crowd (Because it is always crowded. Always), and walk through that door, you will know what I'm talking about. Maybe it's the magical, dim lighting that suddenly transforms everyone into vodka commercial looking people.  Or the fact that any place with a wine cellar instantaneously becomes ultra-sexy in my book, but things at Barcelona seem to operate almost effortlessly, no matter how busy or chaotic they might really be, and it's all very fascinating.

The 14 page long wine list is impressive; I mean it is a wine bar after all. Classic Spanish Rioja wines seem to dominate the list, which is a good change because not too many places in DC seem to showcase this often overlooked wine. I was, however, relieved to see an equally generous list of Malbecs which happen to be a personal favorite. Don't get too excited about the beer here, or the cocktails. The old fashioned, we asked for was pretty nicely done, but...well there have been better. 

Like almost every other place on 14th street, the food was presented Tapas style.  The meat and cheese platter disappeared within minutes, as did the roasted baby carrots (tried to recreate this at home - it's excellent) and the paella. And I made a mental note to save some room for desert the next time.

Barcelona does not accept reservations. At least not in DC. So you're going to have to rely on your own people skills and charms to snag the next available table or seat at the bar. They do have a spacious patio with plenty of dark wood and heat lamps in case all that wine didn't warm you up enough.

Barcelona is kind of like that cool kid in school who was smart, popular AND nice. Annoying, I know. But when it's done in the understated, effortless kind of way, it's easy to like it. The wait can be a little frustrating, so I do hope they start taking reservations soon. Until then, just try and get there a little early. It's worth it. I promise.

It was so nice inside, we decided to dine here after the show.  It was fantastic.  The room is beautiful, the service was perfect....great attitudes by all, with a true spirit of service.  We had the table-side carved ham from Hungary/Spain...a real treat.  After some other meats/cheeses, which were all yummy, we had paella.....which the four guests all have regularly, and can be critical of if not just right.  We left nothing in the pan...it was that good.  

The prior reviews spoke to the service....I talked with the server, and he talked about their outlook on service...it is on purpose...they hire people with a servant's heart.  

This place is new to the DC scene, and this 14th street corridor is filled with lots of funky and interesting looking places.....we had originally planned to go somewhere else, but was seduced by the design of the dining area.....and the seduction was well worth it.  

Go try out this place.  You will most likely have a good time....we all did.  And, should you get there you will understand that this is no bull.

1483,Barcelona Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=p7TqLRfvRwGeFhNpKYo3KQ,"Barcelona is a wonderfully designed restaurant in the bustling 14th street corridor and teeming with energy.  At the same time, this means the average wait time is 1.5-2+ hours on a weekend night at least.  The outdoor seating area is an interesting component with enough heating lamps to single-handedly generate global warming.  

The bar area gets a bit crowded with the usual DC admixture of young professionals, but the bartenders were surprisingly attentive for a DC establishment.  The drinks are fantastic, unique and well-balanced. We enjoyed the bramble and the bourbon spice rack.  Both red and white sangrias are superb.

The food was equally excellent.  Chorizo is prepared with figs in a sweet sauce that is unique, albeit nontraditional.  The texture was slightly more sinewy than expected for the chorizo.  The albondigas were the standout dish with a fantastic slightly spicy tomato sauce. 

What makes this restaurant a 5 star institution is the emphasis on customer service.  The staff initially quoted us a wait time of 2 hours, but after seeing us migrate away from the bar where a few patrons imbibed too much and started arguing with each other over a spilt drink, the host politely rushed us to the head of the line and seated us in quite possibly the most ideally located table in the house.  Then, our waiters were wonderfully attentive.  We received the wrong desert mistakenly and were comped, which was done in an appropriate, polite manner.

The restaurant is so appealing inside and it was clever to close the alleyway to make the glassed in section to add more space.  The best area is the large patio which is so comfortable and inviting.   They even have blankets to use in case you get cold.  How charming!  There was a slight hiccup when we got there because the whole party had to be present in order to be seated and people were running late.  When everyone did arrive we were told we had to wait about thirty minutes even though a member of our party had been waiting for a half an hour already.   Visibly annoyed, we were about to leave for Le Diplomate when another host came and told us we could be seated right away outside.  Since it was a decently nice day all of us agreed and to our delight we had the table right in front of the fireplace.  From then on the meal was a home run.  We ordered a bunch of things to share and it was all delicious and very fresh.  I really liked the eggplant caponata and shishito peppers.  Several people came by to ask how things were (I don't know if this was because of the rough start or not) but it was much appreciated.  Definitely check this place out!

This was not at all the case in what was presented at Barcelona. My significant other and I started with the Meat +Cheese (Jamon Serrano + Manchego + Chorizo Picante). We had originally asked for Jamon Mangalica and were informed that it was not included in the combo, however, it was brought out compliments of the chef. All were prepared to perfection. If ordering, the Jamon Mangalica is worth the extra $. We then moved on to Jamon + Chicken Croquettes and Chorizo + Sweet and Sour Figs. The Fig Chorizo was the best Chorizo dish that I have ever encountered, ever. It happened to be my birthday and Crepes a la Mode were served with a candle, free of charge. Some of my husband's co-workers were in Spain, coincidentally, and he joked that he had the better experience in Barcelona. Enough said? Among the best in D.C., period.

Two people really liked their halibut, another loved his lamb, and the fifth loved her hanger steak.

I was looking for a contemporary American restaurant near my hotel & Proof was under 5 blocks away. After reading reviews & checking out their website, I was excited to have dinner here.
I made reservations for dinner at 6:30 for the next evening via Open Table.

Upon arrival, we were properly greeted by the hostess & brought by another member to our table.  Water for the table could be tap, sparkling or still (they have a Norwegian gadget that ionizes the water & it tastes pretty good, much better than tap). 

Proof is a wine centric restaurant with an extensive menu by the glass or bottle. Their entrance and dining room are surrounded with walls of wines.

We opted to start with cocktails & moved on to wine as our dinner progressed. Our server was friendly & helpful and recommend a nice Chablis to complement my entree of tagliatelle with smoked duck confit.

We ordered:

Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras (5/5) - this was one of the best preparations that I've ever had. Perfectly cooked foie served on sweet cherry short cake was a decadent way to start our dinner.""

Whipped goat cheese with clover honey & flatbread (4/5) - fluffy goat cheese was surprising mild & smooth and the flatbread was perfect.

Burrata with prosciutto & mixed greens (4/5) - house made burrata was delicate & mild with prosciutto to add additional flavor.

House made egg noodle tagliatelle with smoked duck confit (4.5/5) - I try to stay away from too many carbs but will splurge on house made pasta. It was delicious and the smoked duck added the perfect flavor to the pasta with ramps, fava beans & mustard breadcrumbs adding additional texture.

Chef's choice charcuterie board (5/5) - fabulous selection of cured meats including several types of salume. My charcuterie loving bf was in heaven. He said it was some of the best charcuterie that he's ever had.

Sticky toffee pudding cake (4.5/5) - a dessert suggestion from our server was a great recommendation. The pudding cake was moist and not heavy like bread pudding served with vanilla ice cream. Delicious!

Yes, it has an extensive wine list.  But it's also got absolutely fantastic food, great service, an extensive and interesting beer list, and lots of cheeses and other fancy bar snacks.  I have particularly enjoyed the lamb burger, steak, and a couple of variations on scallops.

When to go:  Great for dinner or a business lunch.  A bit of drink and food before an event or a happy hour.  Great wine, friendly sommeliers, and fabulous food to match.  Do not go here you want pub grub, a huge bar, hamburgers and french fries, and a large selection of beer on tap.  

What's served:  The wine selection is divine and marries fabulously with the food.  The food and the wine are equal partners - one does not outdo the other.  The menu offers a solid blend of small eats and big bites to satiate any level of hunger.  You won't find a 12 page menu here (well except for the wine list), but a 2 to 3 pages of well executed dishes, along with a robust cheese and charcuterie selection.  All at a respectable price

As you enter:  You might actually miss the front doors.  A great big sign, flashing lights, and or other flare is unnecessary.  You'll enter a small hostess area and can make your way accordingly.

Bar:  The bar is directly behind the hostess areas.  It's rightly-sized as compared to the dining area and seems to be a staging area for dining guests, or those who intend to stay and enjoy a drink and food at the bar.  Bar turnover is not fast at peak times.  It seems to capture those who want to sit, eat, and enjoy conversation. Bartenders are friendly and warm.  

Dining:  Classically elegant, inviting, and warmly lit without being ostentatious.  Leather backed booths line one side, while the remainder of the dining area are small classic wooden tables, and comfortable chairs.  You can even ask for a small light to read your menu.  Staff are always willing to tell you their favorites and/or recommend dishes.  Just ask!  Don't forget to ask for the sommelier if you can't find your way through the extensive wine list. They are friendly, capable, and fun.

Service:  I've yet to have a bad service day.  The service matches the food and wine.  Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.

Attire:  You'll find most are dressed in city or business attire.  

Reservations:  Recommended Thursday through Saturday.  On a busy evening, you can usually snag bar seating right when the restaurant opens, but good luck after that.  And, given its proximity to the Verizon center the earlier hours may be filled with concert, hockey, basketball, etc. goers.

If you're not a blue cheese fan, no worries! Located right across from the G street exit/entrance of the Portrait Gallery, came here on an early Sunday evening (~5) and no need to wait in line, got a table right away. It was not too crowded and so tis a quiet space to enjoy some wine (or try their cocktails). You can choose from their meats/cheese menu and they also have Firsts (think appetizers) and Seconds (think entrees) menu. If you're willing to make the splurge, I'd highly recommend trying something from each section. A table nearby ordered the Chefs Full Charcuterie Board... I couldn't stop eyeing it.

Altogether, the service, dining space/ambiance, and most importantly food came together for the best dining experience we've had since moving into DC in March. Proof made our anniversary evening one we won't forget. 

I made a reservation the previous week and told the hostess we would be celebrating our anniversary. I asked if the kitchen could fit the tasting menu for our pescatarian diets - no problem! Our server (and Chef Fauset!) greeted us when we were seated with a 'happy anniversary' and this new restaurant immediately felt like warm, welcoming and like home.

Everything from the lighting to noise level and decor is ideal for a date, hosting a colleague/business partner, or just a casual after work happy hour. We wanted to savor our cocktails and wine to the very last drop - we tried the Old Hickory and Broadway Boogie Down and would recommend them in a heartbeat.

For food, if you're like us you'll want to try the ""Trip Down Highway One"" tasting menu - it's a must if you trust the chef and enjoy finding a few favorites to come back for your next visit. You're treated to a generous variety from the menu (and as I mentioned before, they were happy to accommodate our pescatarian needs). We honestly couldn't pick a favorite - each plate was delicious, unique, and satisfied a different part of our palates - but I will say, the ceviche was the best we've ever had. Each dish was perfectly timed one after another with flavors that were savored long after the last bite.

We've found a new favorite and will be back as often as we can. Looking forward to impressing business visitors here, sharing cocktails with friends from work, and of course returning for lunch and dinner for the perfect date!

Proof is conveniently located by the Chinatown metro but tucked just far enough away from the bright lights to save you from running into drunken shenanigans and lost tourists. Read: take the 9th street exit.

The restaurant is very classy but a touch dark with a modern twist. As promised, Proof has an extensive wine list. There is really something for everyone, but be forewarned bottles tend to run on the expensive side, we struggled to find something in the $50 range. 

For appetizer you have a ton of choices ranging from a long list of charcuterie and cheese to hot and cold share plates. My fiancé and I were in the mood for cheese and so we opted for a small board of three flavors which came with bread, honey and other accruements. They also provide delicious crackers as a starter for each table which we utilized for cheese. 

For entries my fiance ordered the flat iron steak and I ordered the grilled swordfish. There were quite a few dishes we both considered ordering so needless to say we'll be back to try them all. There is no shortage of amazing entries at Proof. 

Our food came out quickly and was beautifully plated. Each dish was exquisite and even though our original intension was to share, we both greedily finished our own dishes.

General Manager, Brent Kroll, worked closely with me to craft a menu that was absolutely delicious.  I wanted to do the tasting menu with wine pairings but not exactly as the menu was written.  Brent and Executive Chef, Austin Fausett, were very willing to work with me to find substitutions that I knew would make the birthday boy extremely happy.  They even printed the menu with a happy birthday message for my husband up at the top.

The wine pairings were absolutely superb and the fact that our large party didn't have to deal with menus or decisions made it a 5-star experience.  Alicia helped us during the dinner with the wine pourings and wine/food descriptions.  She was funny, entertaining and patient with our group that was very happy to be together (i.e. sometimes loud and not always disciplined good listeners. . . )

The food:
Oysters
Goat cheese salad
Gnocchi

All of her recommendations were on point. The gf had a glass of red wine that I don't recall the name of but she really liked it. The manager (I think his name was Joe) was also very friendly and nice. For the food:
- Hummus salad (not sure what the exact name of it was): very good. The dressing complimented the chickpeas nicely.
- Gnocchi with pumpkin and mushrooms: divine! It was rich and heavy but you should expect that when ordering something like this. It was mouth watering!
- Tuna tartare: very good. The nori tempura had great flavor that blended well with the tuna. Although the flavor of the tuna reminded me more of a poke. It was delicious!

My friend really wanted to visit the place, but when I called for reservations, the earliest they said they could seat us was 10:00 pm - highly disappointing, but the girl said we could walk in. And thats what we did - on a Saturday, we walked in - at 8:00 pm and were happily seated by 8:15 pm! How awesome was that! The ambiance was like always, phenomenal - low lighting, typical DC style docor, some great people watching too.

Our server was just the best ever! We asked for recommendations on a wine and cheese course. He asked me 2 questions - any restrictions (No red meat, for us) and Red or white? (white). He hooked us up with the BEST selections of cheese I have ever had, and each wine pairing complimented the cheese beautifully! Totally worth the money spent and  of course, my partner's delight at the cheese was hilarious! :)

For a minute, I was disappointed that their new menu was almost 180 degrees apart from the original one - May I take a minute and lament the missing Miso Encrusted Halibut in the to-doe-for curry broth, sigh?! But then I perked up at the sight of the new menu dishes, which sounded so delish! Love the fact that their menu is very minimalistic and appetizing, with options for Vegans/ Vegetarians and meat lovers alike!

We shared the Ahi Tuna and Nori Tempura dish, which was SO good! The Tuna was  seasoned perfectly, did not taste overly fatty and was so fresh. The Nori Tempura - genius!

For the main course, I had the Chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese and my friend got the Tagliatelle. Let me just say this - The Tagliatelle dish was better than what you would find at any Italian restaurant either! The earthiness from the mushroom, the creaminess from the cheese and the crunch from the hazelnuts.. delightfully delectable! I would come here again and again and yet again, JUST for the Tagliatelle, it was that amazing!

The portion sizes are perfect - they fill me up, and yet I Dont feel like a glutton afterwards! :p

We also shared the Warm Chocolate Hazelnut Cake. I am not a fan of espresso, so the sauce threw me off a bit, but the Gianduja gelato - to die for all over again!  The cake was a flourless kind of cake, sort of like a molten Lava Cake. The food had gotten us pleasantly full, and we had no room for dessert really, so we ended up not finishing the hazelnut cake, which was a shame.

Our server was just the most amazing guy ever, SUPER attentive, yet discreet (which is always the key). It was like he was reading our minds throughout - The moment I had a question in my mind, he magically appeared! Emply wine glasses disappeared the same way and food appeared too.. lol!!

Hard to argue after enjoying an excellent dinner here recently.

No reservation, no problem. We just grabbed a hightop table near the bar and started looking over the various drink lists: beer, wine (extensive, obviously), cocktails; they have it all. I was in a cocktail mood and went with the Thatcher Street Sour. Good choice for pre-dinner sipping.

Deciding on a meal was a bit more challenging. Between the appetizers, First and Second selections, so many of their menu items sounded scrumptious. We decided to each get something different with intent of sharing; me going with the ""Grilled Flat Iron Steak with King Trumpet Mushrooms"" and she with the ""Pan Seared Maine Day Boat Scallops.""

However, once the meals arrived, my willingness to actually share was severely challenged with each bite I took of the tender, medium steak. Okay, I did share...but I can't say I was overly excited about it, even though the large scallops were amazing as well. Actually, I believe there were a few satisfying moans during the meal, so I'm hoping we didn't scare too many people.

Then the dessert menu showed up and when it came to deciding on an extremely satisfying finale, the proof was in the pudding...well, actually in the Sticky Toffee Pudding Cake with vanilla ice cream. Sweet baby Jesus was that good, and just big enough to also share, although I probably would have eaten the whole thing without restraint.

Even after handing over a decent chunk of change, I can say we still left here as satisfied as can be. Seriously, do you really need any other proof than that?

If you're looking for a smooth evening, my advice: don't test your luck.

Food: Amazing! Proof changes up their menu every once in a while (seasonally, I believe), but each time that I've gone, my palette and appetite has been met with the utmost satisfaction. Their menu is not what you see everyday. Many ingredients are unconventional but put together in creative ways to bring joy to your taste buds!

But aside from that, the food is amazing. The Butter Crunch Lettuce salad is light and refreshing, with segments of citrus and crispy quinoa. The ahi tuna tartare is arranged napoleon style, with slices of nori stacked in between layers of ahi tuna. It's very fresh and I order it every time I go. The only entrees I've had are the striped sea bass and sauteed pekin duck breast. The sea bass is sitting in a mussel emulsion sauce but is also garnished with mussels (yay!). Both entrees are amazingly good so I won't recommend one over another. I can't opine on the wine list - typically I just order pinot noir or champagne.

Just a note: the doors open at 5:30 sharp. A couple of times when we didn't have a reservation we went to snag a seat at the bar for dinner. People stand outside and wait so if you're looking to eat at the bar, arrive before 5:30.

Also, people, use your heads. If you see a bunch of people standing outside, don't briskly walk past them and try to throw open the doors. They're locked. And you just looked stupid.

Featuring a diverse menu with a number of options both common and esoteric ranging from $12-20 it was with a bit of negotiating that we agreed upon five savories plus three sweets and with the selections delivered in three courses every single plate proved not only well prepared but also impressively portioned considering the prices.  Starting first with tender gnocchi lightly dressed in brown butter alongside a creamy cheese plate before progressing into smooth sweetbreads impeccably balanced by flavors both sweet and earthy alongside a medallion of caramelized foie gras atop a golden pancake and a plate of crispy confit finding levity in acid each of the savories showed a great degree of balance and textural complexity, the latter a quality shared by the desserts whose flavors tended towards the toward the *very* sweet by choice, particularly the uniquely crispy toffee pudding.

When I go out to a nicer restaurant that I won't be able to frequent, I typically try to order as many dishes as possible.

Pro Tip: I guess this is more of a general tip for anyone interested in wine but haven't had too much exposure. When pairing wine with food at a nice establishment such as Proof, trust your sommelier. Too often I hear ""I don't like red wines"" or ""I don't like Rieslings"". If there's a bottle you already know that you like, then buy it a local wine store and enjoy it at home when you're entertaining guests. When you're at the aid of a professional at a fancy restaurant, try to be adventurous and step outside of your comfort zone. If the sommelier suggests something that you are skeptical about, most will be more than happy to pour you a taste before committing to a full glass. Give it a shot, you might be pleasantly surprised :)

Service: always friendly, helpful & attentive

Price: its definitely pricey & more of a special occasion spot (depending on your budget), but well worth the price!

Bottomline: go for it!

For our D.C. stop, Proof had been recommended for us.  We put together a dinner for 12 people.  The events coordinator had us pre-select a menu (as is the policy for 10 or more guests, I guess).  Though the mains were the standard chicken and beef, they were OUTSTANDING.  Not boring at all.  The meal from start to finish was excellent.

Of note: the wines I selected (from their extensive list) were also fabulous and earned me street cred for being someone who picks good wines.  Admittedly, for the champagne at the beginning I had help from a fabulous, respectful, and surprisingly kind sommelier.  My experience with sommeliers is that they're snobby and make you feel as if you're wasting their time.  This woman embodies the antithesis of that description.  She very discretely spoke of price points with me without actually referring to anything by price in front of my guests.  She listened to me and gave an excellent recommendation.  I only hate that the $110 bottle I chose is only $35-40 in most wine shops.  Argh.  I hate mark-ups!!  But that's not her fault.

The dish is paired with chickpeas, lentils, wilted greens, vadouvan, coriander yogurt sauce which was a nice compliment.

1881,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=nig3QkccTdHcJvoZEABkYw,"A wine-lover's wet dream, Proof's wine list is a tome.  You'd be hard pressed to find a better, more extensive selection of wine in the city.  The focus here is on American and French wines, but includes wines from lesser known areas like Canada, Israel and Slovenia.  You could easily drop a fortune on wine (there's no separate reserve list), but for the bargain conscious they do have quite a few bottles for $40 and under, and 32 wines by the glass served in three sizes:  2, 6 and 8oz.  The wine dispensing system is a wonder in and of itself.  It covers the entire wall behind the bar and along with the electronic picuture frames showing copies of works from the National Portrait Gallery/American Art Museum across the street, forms an amazing backdrop.

I like eating at bars, especially when dining alone, it allows me to intereact with the bartender/server a lot more, ask questions about the wine, etc.  Well, at proof at least, so does everyone else because the bar here is always PACKED.  What better way to start a meal than with a glass of bubbly?  Proof's champagne cart is a nice touch and it's nice to know there is more than just one or two choices of sparkiling wine by the glass.  It's a great place for lunch, I know it's not for everyone, but count me as a fan of the shrimp burger; crunchy goodness with jalepeno relish on a bun!  As you'd expect, they also have a great charcuterie and cheese selection; you could make a meal out of these alone!

Great outdoor seating on relatively quiet G Street for those nice sunny days, and the restrooms really need to be seen to be believed.  Also not to be overlooked: bar manager Adam Bernbach's cocktails.  He brought his amazing mixology skills with him from Bar Pillar and along with wine director Sebastian Zutant, they form a great team (the Dynamic Duo?).

Well, I do have a few.  I had never really known what people meant when they said gnocchi were like pillows.  Now I know.  Proof's gnocchi with bolognese was probably the best thing I ate in 2012.  I was upset to have to share it with my date.  I wanted to just bury myself in it and eat only that for days.  The sauce was rich, but there wasn't too much of it.  The gnocchi were just so delightfully light, words are no match for the deliciousness.

Proof is sort of known around town for the ridiculous charcuterie.  We played it safe and just ordered the prosciutto, but boy oh boy it didn't disappoint.  We also went for the beef pho terrine, which was kind of mind blowing.  Somehow they managed to make it taste exactly like pho.  Delicious.

Not only was the food out of this world, but our service was absolutely outstanding.  I was out for a first date, and as a server myself I understand that dynamic can be difficult to work with.

The hubby thought the cheese slices could have been more generous, and I certainly agree for at least one- it was a very small slice, but quality was top notch.

Our server was great- she explained that she has been working there the entire 5 years since it has opened- a testament to a great restaurant environment and management.

1) Everytime we've rolled up here with reservations we've been sitting almost right on time. For someone not in DC this might seem as obvious. However, in DC a reservation means nothing - it just means that you'll most likely get a table within the hour or two after your reservation. 
2) Everything I've had so far has been super delicious. Here's what we've tried:
 - pates: SO GOOD - all of them
 - tuna tartar: fresh, full of flavor, right on
 - hanger steak: yummy
 - lamb: yummy
 - duck breast: also yummy
 - olives: while the portion is a good portion and the olives were good I'm not sure these are house-marinated olives. A good dish but clearly not a ""staple"" of the establishment
 - ricotta past + sausage: as someone who rarely orders pasta I have to say this dish was insanely delicious. This is how pasta should always be done - perfectly cooked, seasoned well, and a great portion. 

The only down side is that when we ordered our second bottle of wine the waitress didn't bring us new wine glasses. While I don't really care a place that is a ""wine bar"" should know better.

1904,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=bt_4pVV6ElNdki-nu_cktw,"omg YES!  I remember when Proof opened, hearing lots of great things and just never got around to getting here.  Well the BF did outstanding (as usual) and made a reservation for Valentine's Day.  Turns out this was a great choice for the occasion because they weren't doing a prixe fixe (I always prefer a la carte)  or anything especially valentine's-y  (which I also prefer).  The restaurant is very dark with a candle set on each of the tables; a very romantic setting.  When our waitress dropped off our menus she brought us both individual lights which were a huge help for reading the menu and and really fun to play with after you've had a few glasses of champagne and a bottle of wine. (I can't recommend the latter on a first date but if your bf already knows you're a fool and loves you anyway, go for it).

Right off the bat I knew I was going to be happy because there was pink champagne on the menu.  The bf had an old fashioned which he said was pretty solid. We started off with some wild boar salume, duck liver mousse with pickled onions and some cheese.  The duck liver mousse was by far our favorite, creamy and rich with just the right amount to not be to filling. Next we had the duck confit, the foie gras and the spicy little meatballs.  Our server, Ashley, who was perfect by the way, told us that she was going to bring the foie gras out last.  She knew what she was doing because this foie gras is outstanding!  The meatball and the duck were both delicious but the foie gras was really on a different level.  Oh and we moved onto wine at this point; what a great wine list!  They are very helpful with making a selection as well.  For the main course we ordered the cassoulet with the carmelized cauliflower (side dish) and shared it.  Whoa is it rich and SO good; duck, pork belly...oh my goodness.  I managed a bite or two while the bf happily spooned up the rest (he's of the lift big, eat big mindset :)). The cauliflower with lemon, tahini and mint was very good and is a great size for sharing but went largely untouched since I needed at least a little room to continue breathing and he was really enjoying the cassoulet. After all this we ordered dessert.  I mean at this point we kind of owed it to ourselves.  We ordered dulce de leche bombe.  If you like chocolate, this is for you.  I had a tiny bite before throwing in the towel and retreating to my rose champagne for the evening but the bf said it was amazing.

Last thing; the service.  Really just perfect.  Every time we wanted our server we looked up and she was there.  She timed everything perfectly and didn't insert herself into our evening other than to make sure we had everything we wanted when we wanted it.

I'm finally glad I made it to this restaurant on this trip to DC!  I can see why it's consistently mentioned in the Washingtonian.  American menu but with a variety of influences from both Asia and Europe on the menu.  Excellent service and knowledge of the items and wines as well.

Bread service includes lavash style breads with a yummy sour cream/chives/olive oil spread... nice change from butter and very tasty.

We started off with the large charcuterie platter which included almost all the salamis and prosciuttos on the list plus the chef's choice of pâté and crispy bread.  This was excellent and perfect for two to start off a meal.  The mustard was very sharp and had a great taste.

We also shared a cheese platter as well, and the restaurant offers you a selection of 3 or 6 off the menu, served with some fruit purée, raw honey and crispy breads.  This was also excellent!  (You can see their entire cheese selection at the back on the way to the restrooms).

For the mains, hubby had an awesome lamb dish with cauliflower and chick peas that had a bit of a Mediterranean influence... Really liked this one.  I had the pan seared halibut which was nice, but not particularly unique.  We both loved the broccolini side dish... well prepared and we loved the combination of the chili, garlic and oyster sauce!

My appetizer began by selecting six cheeses brought from the world over including my favorite, the very creamy, tangy Humboldt Fog goat cheese. The cheeses are beautifully presented with crisp raisin toast points with apple puree, honey, and dates. I saw other patrons make the full charcuterie board and six cheeses a substantial, shared meal.

February's dinner theme centered on hearty winter vegetables including the creative use of kale and brussel sprouts. The pan roasted scallops were placed top of grits and light marinara sauce with a sprinkling of fried kale.

Being a wine bar, the selection of wine was incredible and the server was very knowledgeable about the different wines.

For the first course we shared the veal sweetbread, and ahi tuna tartare. The sweetbread was perfectly cooked and seasoned, it was quite heavenly.  The tuna tartare was incredible. I consider myself well-versed in sushi and the quality of the tuna served was the best I have ever had. 

For the main course she had the hangar steak and I had the soft shell crab. The hangar steak was perfectly cooked, extremely flavorful and awesome! My girlfriend normally does not get her steak cooked rare but she did on this occasion because she wanted to share it with me. She agreed that this was the best steak she has ever had!

1943,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=0_Om05zCeT1-wGVBVR2BWw,"Overall: Responsible for one of the best dishes I've had in a while. Held up on trip two and is complimented by consistently excellent meals, extensive alcohol lists, and fantastic service. Surely a DC great and perhaps the most well-rounded I've visited in a year of excessive dining.
____________________________________________
Ambience (4/5): Contrasted. Large and posh with a mixed crowd that gets professional, which contradicts the varying, attention-grabbing soundtrack and eathy tones of the dimly lit, overly-spacious restaurant. We ate and drank both times at the bar, saving us from forgetting to make day-before reservations, but that clears around 10:15 on a Friday night so come by 11 for late dinner. 
____________________________________________
Service (5/5): Informative and attentive yet laid-back and permitting. You'll never feel rushed or the need to ask for a refill. The sommelier will talk shop--and your ear off--but it's from interest, not arrogance. Proof is a blueprint for service when dining out. 
____________________________________________
Drinks (4/5): The alcohol is pricy. Wine by the glass is a solid selection, but if you plan to drink 2+, scan the bottle list and split something special. Cocktails are equally impressive; anything with gin is worth it. Beers could use more style variety and nuance (saison and sour-lite), but highlights included a few locals.
____________________________________________
Food (5/5): Stunning. Flavor, plating, and variety. At this price, gorge yourself. I've done small plates both times and didn't want to stop. Not a bad dish in seven that I've had, and several are among the very best. (Best to Worst)

1) Pan-roasted Fois Gras - The best seared fois I've had--two plates next time. It sits atop a crisp-edged, buttery pancake that bursts with blueberry. The berry adorned garnish is complete with rich, drying cocoa nibs. All this accents the liver, crisp exterior that melts when cut, sliding off the pancake. Dear god this is heavenly as app or dessert.

2) Warm Duck Confit - Texturally perfect: the salty skin is crisp and separates upon cutting; the juicy duck is fatty and cooked appropriately. The tomatillo keeps the dish light. Both rich and refreshing.. just balanced and delectable in every way. Another must.

3) Ahi Tuna tartare - Seaweed fans celebrate--fresh flavor, crisp, drying.. all that a fish tartare needs in accompaniment. Decorative plating stacks three layers of sesame-drizzled fish between the seaweed ""chips"". The tuna is top-notch texture, room-temp and well diced if in larger pieces. The oil drizzle sets it apart, keeping it both textured and nuanced yet integrated and refreshing--tuna tartare can get too sticky, but this does not.

4) Cheese plate - Really solid selections after some excellent advice, fantastic spreads (the honey-butter is SOLID), and served with excellent bread. Cheese plates can go hit/miss, but this is a definite success.

5) Sauteed Potato Gniocchi w/ Hen Mushrooms - More heavy than hoped, and flavors are solid if lightly too rustic and cheesy. This is saved by the textural combo of buttery, sticky pasta, slick mushrooms, and pea and greens crunch. Large enough to split, and do that because it's profile's too rich to finish on one's own.

6) Spicy Little Meatballs - The meatballs are solid, the sauce standard and hearty yet lightly too sweet. Get it for the goat cheese agnolotti, which maintain a refreshing tang lifting the dish.

7) House-made mozzarella and hot-pepper salad - The only ""bland"" dish I've had at Proof. It was plain, no barking errors but nothing to separate it. A little slick and oily, the wet mozzarella texture not helping. A dry accompaniment with crunch would help.

1960,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=zsF--f6_2t26VHqkY9w1CQ,"Swoon away, my friends - this place certainly brings the romance! Had a lovely dinner here with my partner on a Sunday night. We made reservations, requesting romantic seating if possible, and the hosts obliged by giving us an excellent corner seat so we could eat side-by-side - nice touch! We started with cacciatore charcuterie and a Mediterranean hummus/flatbread plate. Sounds humble, but the flavours were anything but ordinary: the flatbread was somehow both chewy and flakey at the same time, topped with deliciously seasoned hummus, fresh crisp arugula, a scattering of sliced olives, and best of all, a quartered pickled red radish. Mouthwatering! We also were given complementary lavish bread with a creamy and delicious herbed labneh, making for a very generous start to the meal. My partner ordered the cassoulet while I had the potato gnocchi with wild mushrooms, sized up to be an entree. Quite simply, this dish was the essence of gnocchi perfection: pillowy soft, but pan fried for texture, with unmistakeable fresh nutmeg seasoning. Each bite was accompanied by large pieces of buttery and  irresistible shiitake mushrooms and quartered brusselsprouts, with just the lightest sprinkling of freshly grated cheese to take the savory aspects over the top. We finished the meal by sharing a slice of sticky toffee pudding cake, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream: rich and sweet and excellent. I thought I would have to be rolled back to our hotel! I should note also that the wine list is massive; I have seen only a few that have exceeded this. Unfortunately this does make it a bit easy to get lost in, if you are like us and prefer to make your own choices rather than rely on the sommelier (though she was swift to ask if we had questions or would like recommendations). However what I did appreciate though was that the server patiently allowed us the time to select a bottle prior to considering the menu, as we prefer to know what we are drinking before we can decide on suitable food matches. My only other criticism is that, given the reasonable price of the food (and the ""casual fine dining"" vibe), I would also like to see a few more bottles in the $50 range on this huge wine list - in my opinion, there are far too many options at $250+. In the end we were very pleased with our selection of an Argentinian merlot/cab sauv blend, which was flawlessly presented. Overall this was a sublime dining experience with romantic atmosphere, making us savour every moment - highly recommend for date night!

The extensive wine list was a really nice touch, and the sommelier was extremely helpful and made excellent recommendations for wines that would go with our meals. 

We opted for the chocolate cake for dessert which was good, if a little on the dry side, but it was totally saved by the delicious french press coffee we ordered with it.

We came about 30 minutes before our reservation thinking we could have a cocktail by the bar while we waited, but they wound up seating us right away.  We decided to do the cocktails anyways at the table - I had the Brown Derby, which was a nice mix of bourbon with honey and grapefruit juice.  Not too strong, not too fruity, nice mix.  My girlfriend had the Watts for Wifey, which was a very unique mix of tequila with egg whites and cinnamon, which gave it a light and frothy taste to start with a nice strong finish of tequila.  We did a cheese plate with the cocktails, going with three different choices with the help of our very friendly and knowledgeable waitress.  All of her choices were spot on to her descriptions, and we were particularly fond of the goat cheese.
We skipped Firsts, which is rare for me, and decided to share two Seconds, the scallops and the grilled flat iron steak, along with a side of brussel sprouts.  While we both enjoyed the main entrees, the brussel sprouts may have stole the show, as whatever mix of red wine vinegar and olive oil they put on there was just pure perfection.
We paired our entrees with a nice malbec, which is my girlfriend's favorite wine.  We were deciding between three of the cheaper options on their extensive menu, and the sommelier was extremely friendly and helpful.  
Finally, we split the sticky toffee pudding cake per the recommendation of our waitress, and again we were not disappointed!  The sommelier came back out and offered us complimentary glasses of dessert wine that was a perfect pairing to the warm, rich toffee pudding cake, and a perfect way to end the evening.
I would absolutely recommend Proof, and am looking forward to coming back and trying some of their Firsts like the highly-touted gnocchi.

Proof is a moderately price American restaurant with an eclectic menu (their words). It's contemporary design with rustic elements (brick walls, wooden tables and antique dressers) make for a very warm and inviting eating establishment -- the bathrooms are wild! We chose to eat inside because of the high temperatures outside, but their patios looked amazing! I also wanted to mention that the dinner had a lovely pace to it, not too fast and not too slow, all in all it was almost two hours for the three courses which was perfect.
Both our server and somelier were friendly and attentive enough without being over-bearing -- we never once had to fill our own wine glass. We decided to share the starters and chose the Bresaola, which was from Uruguay, cured, juniper scented beef tenderloin ($8US), I thought it was quite tasty although the juniper was very subtle and for $8US I felt we got a good serving size for the price. We also shared the Duck Liver Mousse with Pickled Red Onions & Baby Greens ($11US) and it was over the top, the duck liver mousse was so creamy, yet felt rather light in the mouth. Our server even brought us a nice selection of house made crackers and breads because there are only three crostini's with the dish. We were off to a great start.
My main course (appetizer portion) was the Ahi Tuna Tartare with Crispy Nori Tempura with hass avocado, wasabi soy emulsion ($15) and I must tell you it is by far the BEST tuna Tartare I've EVER had and I've had quite a few. The flavours just hit me perfectly with just the right amount of wasabi (no tears). The crispy Nori was a beautiful contrast in texture to the creamy avocado and the soft tuna. If you can believe it, my mouth is watering as I type this. I could have had two portions it was THAT good.
Hubby chose the gnocchi which came in two sizes, a small appetizer portion and a large main portion -- he chose the smaller size and it was plenty (the bowl was about 24cm or 9.4 inches in diametre. The dish was Sautéed Potato Gnocchi with Hen of the Woods Mushrooms spring peas, baby chard in a sweet farm butter with basil and Parmesan sauce ($15/$27). I had a little taste of this beautiful dish and it was fantastic, but don't let the sauce fool you, even though it's not a cream-based sauce there is A LOT of butter in this dish! Both of our courses were lip smackingly good and I immediately wished we had this restaurant in Toronto as it became a fast favourite!

1974,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=7nhQANAEu6Fg4qVptiSjww,"Proof was the venue for the single most over the top, decadent, gluttonous, and superb meal of all of my time in the District.  Quite possibly, this was the most incredible meal of my life.  I'm having a hard time remembering anything quite this spectacular... on every single level, from the service to the wine to the food.  Simply put, amazing.

A couple house-keeping things: one of our party has a shared friend with the business owner, so we were well taken care of by the staff, and Mark, the owner, personally made recommendations on wines and dishes.  All of that out of the way, I'm glad that I didn't foot the bill, because this joint is anything but cheap.  Regardless, the quality (and I'm certain that we didn't eat anything that anyone else in the restaurant couldn't have ordered) was marvelous.

The charcuterie plate we started with alone was enough to fill four.  Given, we ordered three types of meat and were presented with at least an extra two (of which I can't even remember which they were).  My favorite was the thinly sliced prosciutto and serrano.  I'm a huge sucker for stone-ground mustard, and a dab of that on any slice of meat served to kick up the savory flavors.  The pate won lots of accolades from folks around the table - I've never been a huge pate fan, but this was definitely a winner.  If I can eat it, anyone can... and pate-lovers will be in ecstasy.

We tried two appetizers: the hen-of-the-woods mushroom quiche and a tuna tartar.  Although the tuna tartar was recommended (and it was delightfully fresh), the quiche totally won me over.  I would return for that dish alone (well, and a glass of the Kung Fu Girl Riesling - again, on recommendation).  I'm a sucker for maitake, and this quiche was exploding with 'shroomy flavor.  There wasn't a single bite of the rich, smooth quiche with flaky crust that didn't contain a bit of hen-of-the-woods goodness.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.

Then, there was our entree:  a sablefish special.  Covered with a light miso glaze and served on a bed of Asian noodles, this was enjoyable, but didn't quite hold the same wonder for me as the quiche.  Don't get me wrong - it was flaky, fresh, and cooked to perfection.  Immanently edible, just not an eleven on a scale of ten.

We rounded out the meal with a red (that I don't remember the brand for, but was even -more- rich than the Riesling), a cheese plate, and various desserts.  I'm in love with the cheeses here.  The compte was a discovery for me, but I'm sold.

With some cash in the bank account to burn, I would head back here in a heartbeat.  I would easily recommend this joint as a first choice for anyone visiting DC looking to have a superb meal, or anyone with an expense account and really wanting to treat a client/themselves to a top notch dinner.

Boys, keep your peepers open when you step into the washroom for quite the eyeful.  Don't worry, it's tasteful.  But definitely unexpected.  Even -I- can appreciate fine art like this.

Exceptional dish number 1: the gnocchi I split along with a charcuterie board (which was phenomenal of course) and a shrimp burger (admittedly kind of a miss, the texture was chewy, bordering on rubbery and not very flavorful). There was nothing flashy about the gnocchi, but the amazing flavors and textures were textbook perfect.

Exceptional dish number 2: Sable fish with miso demi-glaze over pureed potato. This was the single best piece of fish that has ever been put in front of me, and this coming from a New Englander! Where the gnocchi was simple the sable fish was refined. A very elegant presentation was the (unnecessary) icing on the cake.

The pumpkin and the sauce complemented the gnocchi perfectly and I honestly don't think I've ever tasted a more perfect blend of flavors.

For dinner I got the Sablefish which was amazing.  The spices were incredible and I don't think I've ever had a fish seasoned that well.  Everyone else's dinner looked great but I didn't try any of theirs.  Some of our party ordered dessert but I didn't try any.  From what I heard, it was good...I think they liked the hazelnut cake better than the toffee cake.  The wine was incredible as well.  Great selection (obviously...).  

I'd say my only negative thought the whole night was right when I arrived.  The ladies working as the hostesses were pretty rude and annoying.  Not enough to drop this review below 5 stars though!

Proof is, simply, a nearly perfect restaurant.  Like libations?  They've got one of the best lists in town.  Good food?  Try anything - it's not over salted, it's not over sweet, it's precisely what you thought you were ordering.  Accessible?  Metro's down the block.

Want a little gourmet mixed in with your day?  Proof will do it, and if you don't mind laying out a $20 for lunch, that Action Jackson will buy you lunch at Proof that will make you come back.

It's the upper end of the three dollar signs, especially if you have a legit meal and any sort of drinks with your meal; expect to pay at least $50 per person.  That said, for the quality of the food, the delicacy with which it's made, the solid service, well, you won't mind.

Things you might not like:  there's no bread basket - they give you tasty crackers.  Their drink list is excellent, but definitely not cheap.  Food can tend towards the heavy side with few light options at dinner; even supposedly light options are fairly buttered or cheesed, so come with an appetite.

For a final note:  if you love duck, this is a place to get duck.

It wasn't crowded, but we didn't feel like dealing with a table and possible reserved ones at that.

We started with a glass of wine each. The glasses are huge, and truly let you enjoy the nose and aroma of the wine. I ordered the rose of the day, and it was unbelievably good. It was darker than most roses I had had, but I enjoyed every sip.

We each chose three cheeses ($13) to sample. I chose one cow, one sheep, and one goat. They were absolutely divine, each in their own way: one creamy, one tougher but bold, and the third was just magically perfect. They were served with honey, applesauce (I know it sounds weird, but it was amazing), cranberry toast bread, and a date (the fruit, not a guy. Ha, we wish!).

We polished off another glass of wine each and headed out for the night, satisfied and ready for action. I loved this place and I will most certainly come back. The three-cheese plate and two glasses of wine came to about $40 (with tip and tax), but it was such a treat for my taste buds!

2136,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=ITfHnc90OfdNYmin4wDQ1g,"I've been to Proof before. They used to have a Restaurant Week menu when they first opened up, but they don't do that anymore. I enjoyed my meal, but it was a time when I was still trying to get into wine, and having to drink a full glass of red with my meal wasn't appetizing to me. This time it was a business lunch, so no drinking for me meant being able to fully appreciate and concentrate on the food.
The first thing I noticed when I looked at the menu was their ahi tuna tartare offering. Huzzah! I would get to check off yet one more restaurant tuna tartare off my list, AND I would get to eat tuna tartare. This day was turning into the Day of the Week! So of course I order that, along with a big glass of water for my hangover, and the rustic veal ragu over garganelli pasta, which is like a rippled penne pasta that looks like it's been rolled. My companions also ordered a cheese plate and a few other firsts, one of which was a very rich cold cucumber and avocado soup (I regretfully did not try any of the soup, as I had just met this woman and didn't think we were on spoon-sharing terms quite yet). The cheeses were accompanied with some sweet little accoutrements, like figs and raw honey. A few of the cheeses weren't really too my taste (a bit too stinky or bleu-ey), but I could tell that they were chosen with great care and precision.
The Tartare. 
When the tartare was brought over to the table, it took most of my willpower not to pounce on top of it at once and claim it as my property. I had never seen anything like it before. The tuna was a deep burgundy color, the freshest I had ever seen in real life or even on Top Chef (Amanda's oxidized tartare from season's past almost killed me on the inside), and it was big! There were three layers of tuna, with blue nori tempura between each. It was peppered with avocados and the usual tartare flavors: sesame, wasabi, and heaven. I even forgot where I was for a moment, and for just a few seconds, I started dancing in my seat and humming my custom tuna-tartare victory song (good food can regress me to a toddler state). Needless to say, Proof is now the proud recipient of my Best Damn Tuna Tartare in DC honor.
My entree was a rustic veal ragu with garganelli pasta. The ragu was wonderful, perfectly thick and not overbearing (as ragu can be), and the pasta they paired it with was cooked perfectly. I don't really like my pastas as al dente as everyone else; I don't see anything wrong with a softer pasta. This garganelli hit just the right note; it was firm but easily digestible. It was accented with parmesan cheese, and I have to say, the entire dish was very simple and straightforward. In other words, it was fantastic!
For dessert, I tried the trio of sorbet: pineapple, coconut and strawberry. Although I really don't like the taste of coconut, it was pretty gently flavored, and the three flavors were all great compliments to each other.
I want to talk a bit about the service I received here. I really appreciate and enjoy unassuming service. Well, the service I received at Proof was exactly what I look for every time I go out to eat (which is probably why I avoid T.G.I. Friday's at all costs). Our waiter was never too far away for help with a menu choice or suggestion. My water glass was filled by their backwaiter ninjas every so often, which is a very important task for the hungover patron, such as myself. Now, I am always looking at the kind of service I receive and the behavior of my server. It's in my nature to do so, and so I usually notice things that no one else ever would. So when I mentioned to one of my fellow diners that that was great service, she said she didn't even notice anything. EXACTLY!
Bravo, Proof. You are steadily climbing my list as a place I will frequent more often than not when it comes to restaurant choices in DC. And that's a LOT of choices. For your impeccable service, a tartare nearing perfection, and a full glass of water at all times, you get 4.5 noms!

First course was a butternut squash soup paired with a madeira (very interesting pairing).  Very delicious dish and wine pairing.  Second course was pan seared scallops.  They only purchase these scallops from a woman in Maine over a 3 week period because they are the best.  These were the best scallops I've had - texture and flavor were amazing.  Scallops were paired with a stainless steeled Riesling.  Third course was a flank steak paired with a very rare and unique french wine that I can't remember.  I was least excited about this course because flank steak is boring, but all the flavors on the plate were very good, and the wine pairing was great.  Fourth course was a choice between sticky toffee pudding cake or cheese plate paired with another fortified wine.  We got one of each.  Usually I think of desserts as chefs' afterthoughts, but this toffee pudding cake was amazing! The cheese plate was also very good.  The honey that was served with the cheese plate was amazing.

Food: Absolutely everything we ate was amazing.  More importantly, everything gets attention at this restaurant, from the accoutrements and vegetables to the perfectly prepared meats. 
-Our table started with a cheese plate and a pate plate.  The pate campagne and the pho terrine were excellent.  The cheese was simply divine (and came with a healthy portion of dates, raisin bread, raw honey and apple sauce).
-We also split the veal sweetbreads, which was one of the best first courses I've ever had.  Order this when you come!  It was paired perfectly with greens, bacon and red grapes.
-For the entrees: I had the duck, which was delicious and matched nicely with the sweet potato and pomegranate.  I also tried my bf's steak, with an amazing leek and mushroom bread pudding as a side.  
-No room for dessert really so we split some sorbet.  It was good, but next time I will have to try that sticky toffee pudding.

Drinks: A great wine list, but we decided to opt for the cocktails.  Their take on the dark and stormy was great, with a nice ginger bite, and the brown derby was also quite good.  A couple others were less successful for my personal taste, but definitely made with good ingredients and well mixed.

Service: Was fantastic.  I know there are a lot of varying opinions on this in the comments but we had a great, great, great service.  We were seated right away when we arrived for our reservations.  Our waiter was fabulous: he was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, and did not rush us at all.  The service was slow (by our choice) but our waiter was always available if we needed refills or new drinks, and when he noticed our bread running out for the cheese course he brought us an extra bowl full.

Went for the first time a few weeks ago before going to see a Wizards game. Proof was the highlight of the night for sure.

Very conveniently located and the valet service made it exceptionally easy for us to leave the car there for the duration of the game (and less expensive than paying a parking garage nearby)

We wanted to try as much as we could without stuffing our faces and literally every single thing was delicious.
This was primarily due to our EXCEPTIONAL waiter. He was very friendly, great sense of humor, but above all, knew what he was talking about. Not only did he have a solid understanding of the menu, but he was able to give really great feedback. 
I usually don't order tofu as an entree (or as anything really, since I love meat) but the dish looked very interesting and our waiter gave it his stamp of approval. I LOVED it. Very tasty and flavorful. My boyfriend had the scallops which were delicious as well.

The interior is open and comfortable, and the wall lined with windows looking out onto the street makes it all the more pleasant of a dining experience.

2183,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=cfn4McDlm8PFua-zAtk7Lg,"Definitely a 5 star experience, although I was in the best company, and it was my birthday. Let me preface this review by saying that while I really enjoy drinking wine, I don't pretend to know a whole lot about it. I'm often intimidated when I'm given a wine list with over 900 bottles to choose from, and feel like I have no idea where to even begin. Since I wanted to enjoy this dinner rather than work at it, I decided to go for wines by the glass, and I asked our waitress questions about the glasses I didn't recognize. She was very knowledgeable and was able to help me pick what I wanted with relative ease. I honestly think that anyone with a regular, not expertly discerning palate, will enjoy the glasses on this menu. If you like chardonnay, you will very likely enjoy the glass of chardonnay. I was very happy with all of the glasses we ordered. You can choose between a tasting serving, a typical serving, and a larger 8.5oz serving. My favorite was the pinot noir (very cliche and Sideways of me, I know).

The atmosphere and service at this place were very nice. They knew it was my birthday, and immediately gave us a complimentary glass of champagne. I always appreciate when restaurants do small things like this, I feel like it really sets the mood for excellent service. Our waitress was attentive without being overbearing, and was very considerate about letting us take our time. It was nice eating outside, it felt very casual and relaxed, which was an excellent contrast to our fancy food and wine.

Your table gets these buttery, flatbread-ish cracker things with a tzatziki-like dip. I like that this is different than a typical basket of bread, and I'm a huge fan of tzatziki. You can also use these crackers for your order of cheese, which is a must at this place. There are SO MANY TYPES OF CHEESE. I LOVE CHEESE. You can get 3 types for $13, and 6 for $25. I could literally come back here, and just drink wines by the glass, and eat cheese. We ordered the L'Amuse Gouda, the Cave Aged Gruyere, and La Tur. The cheese plate came with hard pieces of raisin bread, which I enjoyed even though I don't love raisins, as well as some raw honey and applesauce. The raw honey with the salty cheese was absolutely decadent.

Next, we ordered the foie gras, which was also very good. We also ordered the gnocchi, which I would not recommend. I thought it was a little overcooked, and the whole dish felt sort of soggy and unappetizing. After all of that food, we barely had any room left, but being in a gluttonous mood, we decided to split an entree, and got the branzino. My boyfriend loves fish, and thought it was the best fish he had ever had. It literally just melted in our mouths.

For desert, we split the sticky toffee cake, which is supposed to be their best dish. It was good, but to be quite honest, I could have gone for some more cheese. If you aren't super in to toffee, you won't love this dish, even if it is supposed to be their best. I should have ordered the chocolate cake.

Overall, despite the gnocchi and the toffee cake not being absolutely incredible, this place is still a 5 star spot for me. I would rush at any opportunity to go back, and I recommend it for any occasion.

I would only ask management to try to tone down the smell of bleach that emerges from the bar area around 9 or 10 in the evening. Not good for drinking wine!

I usually order the salmon, but the duck and pork chop are delish too. I'm not sure where all the gnocchi hate is coming from because I thought it was great.

I have to say, though, that Proof met all of these expectations and to top it off, wow-ed me with a melt-in-your-mouth Angus beef steak.

Our party ordered a champagne trolley (how fun), some wine and a three-cheese plate to start things off.  I felt like they had a pretty good selection of cheeses that could please almost every palate, my favorite being the Cana de Cabra (Spanish goat!).

Our main courses were fabulous:  a Double Smoked Scottish Salmon Flatbread appetizer, the Black Sesame Crusted Organic Salmon, and the Grilled Angus Beef Hangar Steak.

We (bf and I) started out with a couple of 2 oz pours of a pinot blend that was wonderful -- thought we'd try something before making a final decision about how we would go about ordering from a 50 page wine list.  Alas, the bottle was close to $70.  We ended up opting for an $18 (yes! $18!) bottle from Jumilla, because we have been digging on the Jumilla wines lately and well, it was dirt cheap.  And it was fine.

As for the food, we started with the ""full charcuterie board"" because we are charcuterie freaks.  We were not disappointed -- it really is the full monty -- about 12 different cured meat selections, some gherkins, and mustard.  The fennel salami was the favorite.  It was a huge serving size for two people, and we were pretty much full after that point.  But we pressed on.  We decided against entrees, as there were so many appetizers that sounded amazing.  We wanted to order 5, but decided to ""start"" with 3 -- so glad we did, it was more than enough food.  

I had seared fois gras for the first time in life.  I was a little tentative since I don't like liver, and the reputation for animal cruelty is a bit of a turn off.  Oh well, I'm a convert.  It was like eating a divine cloud of subtle yet rich fat. It kind of blew my mind. It was served over a really tasty almond puree. 

We also got sweetbreads.  This was my least favorite dish, but only because the bacon taste was a bit overpowering.  But that's not the worst thing in the world, is it?  It was still pretty damn good, and bf loved it.

We decided to break up the offal with a roast beat, goat cheese, and hazelnut salad. It was as good as it sounds. Finally, we finished off with 3 cheese selections, our waiter lending an opinion or two when we asked.  Total for all that meat, various organs, cheese, 4oz of wine plus a bottle?  $125.

All in all it was a great, memorable meal.  The decor is classy and a step above for Washington, the leather chairs comfortable, the music at an appropriate level. The service was friendly and knowledgeable.  I look forward to going back and trying the things we failed to order (pork belly, mini meatballs), and to see their seasonal selections in the fall.

I was skeptical of her choice, because going to a nice restaurant and getting chicken...how good can it really be?  Well, Proof's chef has changed my whole view.  It was the BEST chicken dish I've ever had.  I don't know what they did to it, but it was moist, juicy, flavorful and not the same old chicken that everyone else serves.

He even went back to check if there were any off-menu bottles that he thought we'd enjoy (he did find one, though we ended up ordering something that was on the menu).  He answered questions about the food, brought us a little sample of port (which had been used in one of our cocktails) because it paired extremely well with our dessert.  The other staff were great as well.  Plates were cleared quickly, water glasses were never empty, etc. etc.  Overall, I think the service really made this whole experience top notch, and I only wish more restaurants understood how much of a difference friendly, knowledgeable, attentive staff can make.  Bravo.

On top of that, the food is delicious.  The menu changes seasonally, but for this meal, we started with a cheese plate and duck liver mousse, which were good.  Then we shared the squash gnocchi with kale and roasted brussel sprouts (delicious.  little puffy clouds and not doughy cement balls - just how gnocchi should be) and also split the tuna tartare with nori tempura.

Foie Gras Tourchon with Pistachio and Toast Points: Wonderfully executed 

SECOND
Grilled leg of lamb sliced over a salad of tomatoes and panzanella - I know what you're thinking...it sounds really simple... I know... Tom Sietsema didn't like it.... I know.... How good could it be? I asked myself the same questions when one of my dinner mates ordered it....and...hmmm......it was PERFECT.  The tomatoes, like another reviewer said, were like nothing I've ever tasted.  Incredibly flavorful, sweet, succulent, just unbelievable.  I really really really hope the chef brings back this dish next summer.  I almost forgot about the lamb, it was delicious, tender and perfectly cooked.  To me, an unforgettable dish, to my friend who ordered it, a meat and starch guy who doesn't like tomatoes, it was the second coming of Christ. 

Miso Glazed Wild Sablefish bok choy potato pure, and shiro miso sauce - Recommended vehemently by our server.  It was an absolute dream.  The Sablefish was immaculately prepared, crisp and tender, its rich and wonderful flavor profile was perfectly outlined by the slightly tart sauce and the potato puree, which was delicious on its own.  

THIRD
A great selection of cheeses, it was hard to decide but I selected three.  A French and Spanish goat cheese, and a buttery French cow cheese.  They were all excellent, served with toasted bread, a wild honey spread, apricot spread and figs.

THE WINE
 I had three glasses- two reds and a white, selected for me by our fantastic server with recommendations from the sommelier, Sebastian Zutan.  They couldn't have been more complimentary to my meals, each sip harmonized perfectly with the savory flavors in my tongue while appetizing and refreshing my palate.

We sat at the bar for dinner because the restaurant was full but it didn't detract from the experience. Our appetizer of white tuna crudo glazed with miso and soy just melted in our mouths. My ale-braised pork belly was superb - it came with a corn spaetzle with bits of apple and blue cheese. Every calorie was worth it. Thankfully, this dish is offered only during the winter b/c I don't think my waistline could handle it. My friend's sablefish was rich and flavorful, as fatty as a piece of fish can be. Proof, however, is not exactly a cheap eats destination. The wine is reasonably priced so my wallet won't take too big of a hit for being a regular.

2251,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=Dc3bE3vwoYC_8trVAyHZrA,"Proof is really almost but not quite 5 stars, but I don't have the heart to round down. 

Low lights, brick walls, dark wood floors, leather booths and brass accents give a very romantic, adult feel to Proof. It manages to be both modern and classic at the same time. Like the menu there are soft Asian touches like antique Chinese chests mingled in with more European style. The classic dining area is accompanied by some particularly naughty bathrooms, which you'll have to check out for yourself, in a cheeky design choice. Proof is on the expensive side, our final bill before tip came in around $125 for a feast for two, but I think it's justified by the impeccable service, ambiance and creations of Chef Karoum - recent winner of the lively Capitol FoodFight. Though Proof is chiefly known as a wine bar, we drank not a drop and left entirely satisfied. 

The beer list is surprisingly strong and the accommodating waiter was pleased to make recommendations and bring us samples. Our big bottles of Troegs Perpetual IPA and Epic Imperial Red Ale were both delicious. 

We started with sautéed potato gnocchi, which was really scrumptious though not quite pillow-y perfect, and the duck and foie gras wonton soup - a unique, brothy delight. The halibut over coconut-curry was good but not great. The fish was clearly of superior quality and cooked perfectly, but the curry was a bit bland for me. Proof's modern, American take on Peking duck was incredible. The crackled skin and meat was spot on, the sweet potato puree was a soft, lovely companion and the pomegranate emulsion provided the perfect punch. Our stomachs full but our eyes still ravenous, we opted for a cheese plate for dessert. Proof offers an eclectic selection of cheese and our sociable waiter was more than happy to help us pick. The three we chose were absolutely delicious. The accompanying sauces and breads were equally wonderful. Unable to finish, we took most of the cheese plate home and felt something like kings drunkenly feasting on fine cheeses in bed later that night.

This being our first time to the DC area, I turned to Yelp for a reliable restaurant for a birthday dinner.  Several restaurants stood out but Proof really caught my attention.  

Just on the edge of Chinatown, Proof sits in a corner fairly unassuming.  The restaurant is simplistic and beautiful.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant with the cheese station on one side and a glass wall of wine in front.  The tables are close enough where your privacy is minimal.  If on a special dinner date or business dinner I would suggest a requesting a booth.  

The wine menu is very impressive.  They offer wines for all palattes and wallets, and if that wallet is deep then you may select one of the five vintages of Colgin or the four vintage of Screaming Eagle, or how about that Petrus.  With 20 plus pages of wine, there is something for everyone.  The dinner menu had me stumped.  Everything looked delicious.  They do offer a four course prie fix menu for $50+ dollars, but I did not want to be restricted to that.  Mrs. H chose a salad and entrée and I opted for several small plates.  The salad was reviewed has okay, nothing wonderful about butter lettuce, two wedges of grapefruit and dressing.  Redemption came in the form of Alaskan Halibut with a coconut curry emulsion.  The fish was cooked no less than perfect and the sauce was well balanced and compliment the fish.  I started with the Pate Campagne.  Moist and full of flavor; a richness of bacon and a sweetness from the cherries.  Perfect.  Next was the beet salad.  I am not one for salad but beets are a favorite.  The vinaigrette was light and the goat cheese was creamy and pair well with the roasted beets.  The carrots however, were under cooked and unpleasant to eat.  My redemption came was the next course of the pan seared sweetbreads.  These were seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The loosely cooked egg in the middle of the dish I did not get and seemed unnecessary.  The mushrooms and the champagne grapes were a flawless compliment to the sweetbreads.  We passed on desert and chose a few cheese to end our meal.  They have a wide selection of cheese with sides of raw honey, apple sauce and crostinis.  

To top of the wonderful meal, the service was over and above.  At a restaurant like Proof, they need service staff that love food and wine, it only enhances the experience at the table.  Our server was just that.  He had a passion for food and wine, and loved the job.  He suggested many great dishes and was always there when needed but never hovered.

My sister is very discerning, so I was quite proud of myself when she deemed Proof's food swoon-worthy.  And it was!  We split something from each course and left very very happy.  

First course: Trio of artisanal salume.  A lovely arrangement, served with whole grain mustard and cornichons.  

Second course: flatbread with chickpea puree and smoked eggplant reduction.  While very tasty in the moment, after the meal we realized that this was far outdone by what came next...

Third course:  Venison on a kabocha squash puree with brussels sprouts.  This dish worked.  Everything about it was perfect.  The meat had the texture of filet with a lot more flavor.  And the sprouts stood up to it nicely. 

Dessert: CHEESE!  oh my god...  so good.  Also, our server recommended to us a dessert wine that was not on the menu that was heavenly... we had some coffee too.  Good stuff.  

Oh yeah, I guess I should comment on the wine.  The list is great.  I had a glass of tempranillo and my sister a glass of Malbec.  Both went well with the venison.  I'd like to come back and do more wine tasting here.  Our focus was mostly on the food this time around.  I'll definitely be back.

From other reviewers and pictures on their website, it seemed to be the right balance between trendy and romantic. When my gf and I go to dinner, the evening usually revolves around the meal itself. Both of us were extremely excited about Proof, and our expectations of both the restaurant and the meal were extremely high. Proof did not disappoint.

We made a reservation for  Thursday evening, and the place was still packed. Despite this, the hostess said it would only be a 5 min wait for one of their coveted booths if we wanted to wait. We happily agreed. Proof doesn't reserve their four booths, and yet they are the best seats in the house.

We started with a selection of 3 cheeses, paired with a 2oz glass of wine suggested by our waitress. She was both attentive and knowledgeable, making suggestions all night that eventually led to an amazing meal. My gf had the duck, which was absolutely fantastic, while I had the delicious halibut. The highlight of the night came with a simple side dish we stumbled upon: the cauliflower. If you ever have the chance to go to Proof, make sure you order a side of the cauliflower. Probably one of the best things on the menu, and I'm not even a big fan of the vegetable.

We finished the night with dessert of course, we had both the rhubarb short cake and some chocolate concoction I forget now. For what we paid, it was an amazing night that revolved around our meal.

I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with everything at Proof.  They offered valet parking which was convenient especially with Saturday night parking issues in that area.  It was 12 dollars but that's DC for you and valet prices.  I'm not complaining as we were late or just on time for dinner.  It was a warm Saturday night so it was nice to see folks outside on their patio area eating and enjoying wine, it was very crowded.

We were seated in the booth style table by the bar and it was very dark in the dining room, but I enjoyed the ambiance.  The decor is great and I was hoping the food would be just as satisfying as the mood I was feeling.  We ordered some Cabernet, the Blue Rock which was excellent.    I have heard from my father who is a connoisseur that it was a great cab and he was right.  Our party of four started with the foie gras and the tuna tartare on the recommendation of Adam Swetlow (our old friend).  WOW!!! I described to everyone that the foie gras tasted like a party in my mouth....yes, it was that delicious.  The tuna tartare was just as fantastic.  I have been to many restaurants over the years and tasted many tuna tartares, Proof's by far is the best. 
On to the main course, our party ordered the Halibut and some other fish dish with sesame seeds on what tasted like a bed of curry...whatever it was (can't remember due to the enjoyment of my own meal) both fish plates were awesome.  I ordered the hanger steak and I must say I'm glad I did.  I was hesitant as the last time I ordered hanger steak was at Mon Ami Gabi and it was awful.  I decided to plunge in and take another risk....it was worth the risk and the result was fabulous.  The steak was perfectly medium rare, moist, flavorful, and just the right amount.  We also had the grilled eggplant salad and that was fantastic as well.  Time came around for dessert and I cannot for the life of me remember what everyone shared, but I know it was good.  I did not partake in tasting dessert as I am not big on sweets, but I did order another plate of the foie gras for my own dessert dish.  Yes, it was that good...

Overall, Proof was a great experience.  The service was not exceptional but not bad either.  The ambiance and decor were nice but the food was fantastic!  Next time I will have more wine.  By the way, the bathroom was  very neat with pictures of naked women and very modern sinks but I couldn't seem to get the water flowing as there was no knob or lever...that was a nice little laugh for my friend and I.

Although the menu only offered a wine tasting, the staff easily accommodated our request for cocktail pairings and the bartender presented us with specially designed drinks to complement every course on the menu.
And WOW! The cocktails did more that just complement the food or refresh the palate, they became intertwined with the dishes, hints of sweetness and savoriness, melting in the mouth to create new and transformed flavors. I could not imagine eating the food with the cocktails any more that I could imagine eating without salt.
The tasting menu started with a pumpkin soup with scallop. The soup was reminiscent of a New England clam chowder, with the creamy pumpkin acting as a base and the smokey scallop substituting for the clam. For the main course, there was duck served justly rare, sitting on top of a sweet potato puree with drippings of a pomegranate glaze. Thereafter was a simple cheese plate, accompanied by honey, dates, and bread (it was almost an exact replica of what I had at L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon). The final dish was soft, warm, possibly flourless chocolate cake, that melted in the mouth. It was all delicious.
I wish I could describe the cocktails in such detail, but I would have had to take notes. They were all exotic, sweet and savory with ingredients that probably have never graced your liquor cabinet. Coriander, artichoke bitters, and quinine were a few that I remember.
DC is the kind of town where it's easy to pay for 1st class food and get a 2nd hand experience, but Proof is not the place.

Only complaint (and I hate to say that) was that once it got a little bit later, the lighting was just a little too dim to read the menu or see the food.  

Our server was Max, and he was delightful.  Gave a great wine recommendation and did not rush us along at all.  In fact, we were there for about 3 1/2 hours! I do wish he had mentioned doing small tasting glasses with the different dishes--I probably would have--but the glass of wine he recommended was exactly what I had described I wanted.   My husband went for the mixed drink.  I forget what he ordered--it was a heavy hand in vodka, but still a very good cocktail.

The food was absolutely AMAZING.  We were first brought flatbreads with a light cucumber yogurt sauce.  It was very fresh and the perfect summer taste.  We started with a cheese board and went with 3--cows, goat, and blend.   The cheese board came with a small side of honey (incredibly decadent--we could have drank it!) and peach puree.  While the cheeses were all delicious, we could have done with more bread.  At first, they only sent on three little toasts for three people.  However, our waiter happily accomodated us when we requested more bread and honey.

Then, we ordered three firsts to share-the ahi tuna tartare (amazing!), the gnocchi (superb!) and the octopus sald--a new dish that was a home run.  It  was a very harmonious dish with the fennel and fingerling potatoes, a small bit of acid and succulent octopus.  

We then ordered another round of firsts-foie gras and the wagyu beef.  The foie gras was a favorite--cooked perfectly. The wagyu beef--while a prety presentation had too much siriacho chili on it --you couldn't taste the beef, only the chili.

We also split the sablefish.  It was incredible-light, buttery, and melted in our mouths.  The noodles were a great accompaniment. 

I didn't feel the menu was that difficult--or complicated.  You can either choose to share all of the dishes or not.  The firsts are a bit smaller and the seconds are entre sizes--not HUGE but bigger than firsts.  If you shared one or two firsts, you could have a second and feel very satisfied.

The music was a lot of fun and the bathrooms also had fun spunk and great detail.

I would return in a heartbeat.

2371,Proof Restaurant,/user_details?userid=6qkiuERzs4G-SkXs4YEz3A,"I brought an out of town friend to Proof, originally with the intention of grabbing drinks and appetizers. We ended up arriving late enough that something more substantial was in order, especially with the blustery weather. I was surprised to be told there would be a wait - 30 minutes to an hour - at 7:45pm on a Monday night. We opted to walk around (read: I wanted to go to American Apparel) and the hostesses were nice enough to take down my cellphone and offer to call when there was a table ready. 

Less than thirty minutes later we received a call that our table was ready and wandered back to Proof. By this time the crowded restaurant was almost empty - a little more than half a dozen tables were filled - and we settled into a low-lit table. Perhaps the restaurant was a little TOO low-lit: I'm not yet ready to reach for reading glasses at the ripe age of 23 and I was squinting in my attempt to read the menu. Fortunately I wasn't missing out - the waiter came to take our drink order and we realized that we had been seated sans wine menu. The waiter was friendly and suggested a nice glass of red wine for both of us that we pared with three cheeses ($12 for a mild cheddar, goat, and parmesan? -  my friend picked, being a cheese nerd, and I was only happy to oblige). The cheese came with some fig crisp bread, pear butter, honey, and figs which work equally well on their own as they did with the cheese.

I didn't have any more wine and can't claim to know much about wines. I will say the wine list that we saw wasn't terribly extensive but thorough. My friend's eyes lit up and he was like a kid in a candy store when he spied a barbera on the wine list - at $18 a glass definitely a splurge but it was a great glass of wine - a unique beginning, middle, and end that tickled my palate.

From the ""firsts"" section of the menu we ordered the Yukon gold potato gnocchi ($14, small), with chantrelle mushrooms and onions. The gnocchi were tasty but overshadowed by the onions - if they offer them with another accompaniment (it changes from time to time) give them a try. We also tried the veal sweetbreads ($13) with bacon and spinach - a tidy and tasty dish that my friend happily inhaled. I tend to think too much about sweetbreads and don't enjoy them as much.

I had my eye on the pork loin for the ""seconds"" but had eaten so much food we agreed to split the venison (~$24), which was cooked rare and served on a puree of kabocha/japanese squash and with a side of roasted brussel sprouts. The venison was superbly cooked - a nice pink center with a nice crusty outside, and the gamey meat coupled well with the sweetness of the kabocha. I tried the brussel sprouts but I've never been a big fan and couldn't say much about them other than this is probably the best preparation I've ever had them in.

None of the desserts particularly grabbed me so we finished with warm drinks - they serve Harney & Sons tea (mmm!) and my friend had a macchiato, done properly with a wonderful dollop of foam. 

The food at Proof doesn't grab me - the execution is excellent but I'm uninspired to try anything and wish that there were a better rotation (in many ways Proof is a nod to Sonoma and Mendocino and I wonder if they wouldn't do well adopting the truly seasonal menu like those restaurants as well). 

What made my dining experience at Proof truly 5-star, however was THE SERVICE. I've mostly neglected it thus far but I cannot stop raving about how wonderful the service is at Proof. The hostesses were sweet and helpful, our waiter was affable and the right mix of everything. He was helpful, happy to provide suggestions and equally happy to approve our orders and provide explanations of what was set before us. Our food arrived perfectly timed - I was never waiting for a course to arrive or a water glass to be filled. The table was de-crumbed after our first course, and our waiter even re-folded my friend's napkin when he went to the restroom. Support staff were friendly, not cold and un-acknowledging as most usually are. Just, wow. I also have the impression that our waiter, wonderful as he is, was not the exception to the service rule. Observing the other waiters and waitresses, they all seemed equally attentive and affable. If you need proof that good service exists in Washington, D.C. simply head to Proof. 

(An aside: make sure to visit the restrooms. The women's restroom is decorated in a modernist-Victoria's Secret style - hot pink accents, stainless-steel fixtures that look like they're from a class airplane lavatory, and wallpaper that is, on second look, fishnet legs and bustiers in a diamond pattern. In contrast the men's restroom is silver and black, much more sleek, with photos of perfect posteriors facing one when standing at a urinal.)

i was swooning and collapsing against the booth every other bite.

we ordered a bottle of Shardana, and the tuna tartar and beef sashimi appetizers. the tuna was so freaking delicious! it came with soft chunks of avocado and crispy seaweed. the beef sashimi was delicious, too. like a peppery carpaccio.

for en trees, we shared the leg of lamb and the hanger steak. GOD DAMN that leg of lamb was no joke. the hanger steak was delicious too - the greens with bacon side dish that came with it was outstanding - but the lamb out shined it.

for desert we picked three cheeses. i can't remember exactly which ones, but something like a manchego, pecorino and some french soft, mushroomy cheese. so good.

In this category, though, Sonoma is definitely a top-notch choice, whether for date night, the parents visiting, or just a night out on the town.

Everything about it just seems to hit the right note. The overall ambiance is incredibly muted so as not to distract from your excellent meal, from the low lighting to the exposed brick walls to the sign on the front window that you could walk right by without ever noticing. The staff are always very friendly, ready with a recommendation but never pushy. The food is always delicious, from the great selection of cheeses to the pastas (my favorite being the carbonara, with a raw egg cracked right on top while the pasta is hot) to the main courses to the desserts. I can't remember ever having eaten a dish here I didn't enjoy immensely. The wine list seems fine to me, not being a connoisseur, and I can always find one I like, or try one of the little tasting flights for some variety.

I have been to Sonoma a number of times over the last few years and I've always had a great time. I live on the hill, so I can attest that it is one of the better options.  The wine list is phenomenal because you can get so many wines by the glass--and there is totally a range from lower end to higher end, yet all at least decent/drinkable quality. I've never had a wine that I hated, and I always get the vibe that if I did, the staff would take it back.  They're pretty responsive.  

The food is always really delicious. I've had the main courses, I've had the pastas and the pizzas, and the delicious array of charcuterie and cheeses. I may sound overly enthusiastic, but it really is a lovely place and not cheesy in a way that some places on the hill are (zest, matchbox, i'm looking at you).  

The entrees are about 20+, the pastas you can get in half portions, they have burgers. It's a place you might find in new york (except more spacious so you're not always bumping into people), or in cleveland park (except ever so slightly cheaper). It's great for a casual date night, for a night with a girlfriend or two, for a glass of wine at the bar.

When our ceremony venue cancelled on us, Roneeka stepped right in to say that they would be able to accommodate us for the ceremony -- without the typical fee that would be associated with that service.  We ended up finding another location for our ceremony, but the gesture was very kind and the flexibility and willingness to help reaffirmed our choice for the reception venue.

Our reception was a standing cocktail reception, with the food set up in the Private Dining room in the back.  The bartenders and wait staff ensured that our guests waiting in line for food had a drink if they wanted one and paid constant attention to myself and my groom throughout the evening.  We also had tons of compliments on how delicious the food was.

We had reservations, and they seated us right away. We even changed the time of the reservation, and it was a breeze to do. However, reservations need to be made by phone, or through OpenTable.com. 

First, we must mention our waitress Karima. She was amazing, and everything she recommended came out delicious and perfect to our liking from beginning to end.

Now the food:
The tomato bisque was light, creamy, and very delicious. We each had a bowl of it. 

The first entree was a sonoma carbonara linguine: housemade, guanciale, oyster mushrooms, grana padano. organic egg [this is off the menu]. But from me, it was just good. 

My friend and I decided to share everything so that we both could try more dishes. The sauce was so flavorful that we both felt that it could be eaten with just bread and it would be enough. 

The second entree was the 28 day aged steak. It's a 16 oz NY steak. We shared this as well, and so glad we did.  Juicy, tender, flavorful, cooked rare to perfection. It was not bloody, but just red enough. I am still drooling over this steak and it was 2 days ago that we went! The steak sauce is house made and served in a little creamer cup. The mashed potatoes were just ok for me, but my friend thought they were delicious as well. I felt that the mash potatoes were necessary because the steak came with a some salted arugula and it was perfect with the steak. 

Then dessert. We got the creme brulee and the trio of ice cream. The creme brulee was delicious. I liked it better than the trio of ice cream. The ice cream flavors were interesting: maple, apple, and pear. The pear was the best.

The atmosphere is nice and simple. Some of the tables in the back were long family style benches and long wooden tables. Booths line the opposite wall. 

The wine selection was pretty good. I was in the mood to for a Sangiovese so I ordered the 3 Wives based on Karima's recommendation. Medium bodied, smooth, and dry. I liked it a lot.

We couldn't decide between two entree dishes -- gnocchi with shrimp & pesto or lobster risotto -- so we ordered both and the kitchen split each into separate dishes for us. Both were incredible so I'm glad we did that! Oh and the desserts?? Amazing. We enjoyed the goat cheesecake with blueberries & strawberry shortcake.

They have wine flights, which can always be fun. I ordered the ""tiny bubbles"" flight but was served the rose flight. I noticed it right away and was allowed to keep the rose flight plus was served the bubbles. The attention to detail & customer satisfaction is high on the wait staff's list. My husband wasn't drinking and there were long stretches where he'd go without a water fill. This is not a negative, but nothing here is complimentary. The bread is a heavenly grilled foccacia, but it comes at $3 for two small-ish slices. It's delicious but doesn't go that far with a table of three.

She let me choose the restaurant...I chose Sonoma because I love wine bars and I had walked by it numerous times on my way to Pour House and always thought as I walked by ""I really need to try this place."" A girls lunch was the perfect opportunity to do so!

The space is not very wide, but it's pretty long. Tables are close together, so if you don't like dining almost on top of the people next to you, this is not the place for you. I loved the dim lighting and exposed brick. Basically I was in love with the decor and atmosphere before taking one bite. I also loved that our waitress was sweet about letting us linger and take our time with ordering. We never felt rushed which I appreciated.

I loved that Sonoma opened their entire menu for Restaurant Week - you got to choose an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. Additionally each day they had a bottle of red and a bottle of white available to add to the RW menu for $20.11. Of course once my girlfriend and I heard that, we quickly decided to get the day's white wine bottle which was a pinot grigio. 

To eat I started with the burrata crostini, followed by the goat cheese and pesto pizza, and topped off with the chocolate dipped olive oil cake. The crostini was a nice, light way to start the meal, and I thought the burrata was delectable. I could have easily ate half the pizza and saved the other half for lunch the next day, but it was so good, I gobbled every single bite without hestitation. I have had olive oil cake before, but never chocolate dipped olive oil cake. The chocolate shell protected the moist cake underneath perfectly. Needless to say, every bite of that was consumed as well. After tax and tip, my girlfriend and I each paid $55 which was really reasonable for a three course lunch and a bottle of wine. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and experience at Sonoma and am looking forward to going there for another lunch, dinner, or just to pop in for a glass of wine and a small bite the next time I am in the Capitol Hill area.

The tables downstairs were a little too close for my comfort (we could hear both conversations on either side of us), but the lounge area upstairs made up for this lack of intimacy. The bathrooms...EH (to my surprise. But then I like to rate bathrooms :)

We started off with...the best.....Pinot Noir......EVER. Of course I forgot to write it down and it's not on their online menu, but it was the $15 one, if that helps. Oh my god, so great. My boyfriend doesn't like dry reds, but he LOVED this Pinot Noir.  And I'll go to my grave never knowing the brand. Anyway, we got the Cheese and Charcuterie flight, which included all the accompaniements for free. That whole thing was just out of this world. We got the Camembert cheese and in retrospect, wish we would have gotten the Ewe's Dream, as the Camembert was basically just like a mild, whipped cream cheese. Kind of a waste. The Ewe's Bleu and the La Mancha was very good though. The duck salami, i thought was EH, but my boyfriend loved. The bresola and culatello was so great. 

The burger with Gruyere cheese was AWESOME, definitley get that. We also got something else, but i forget now. Our 2nd wine was the Sullivan Vineyards cab, because i wanted something earthy and leathery, and it was SO GOOD. It almost had a ""gamey"" tannin. 

We nixed dessert because we were stuffed, but went up to the lounge and had a couple more drinks on the cozy couches. Again, very attentive waitstaff. I think some of those waiters like to reccomend wines that are of the ""pricey"" varietal, rather than going by what you're asking for necessarily, but you can't deny that it's great wine.

The highlight of my dinner was the local tomato-forest mushroom bruschetta with herbed sheep's milk ricotta. I also enjoyed the 
stone mustard braised shoat on grilled ciabatta with chard and grilled peaches.

Because Sonoma offers wines in smaller ""tasting"" sizes, I was able to try both the 2006 ""J"" - a Pinot Gris from the Russian River Valley AND a Sangiovese/Nebbiolo from Napa Valley and make it home still on the sober side of things.

A hugging, black pencil dress with tights and boots worked well (it was cold) and I sat at the bar, like some clandestine 40s actress, sipping (maybe gulping, but you can't gulp wine) a full bodied red.  If I had a cigarette in my hand and a fedora, I might have expected a mafioso or detective to pull a stool up next to me, but alas- I was missing these two necessary items and therefore, no action.

But a muscular man with his long (think: European footballer) hair pulled back did finally come in, and sit next to me, two glasses of wine later.  During those two glasses, I reflected on the irony of not being the late party for once.  Les temps est une invention des gens incapables d'aimer.  Maybe being late is a sign of passion.

We split a ""white"" goat cheese pizza and calamari salad.  We were the last to leave- and I very much appreciated the staff happily idling until we realized we were holding them up.  Their grace did not go unnoticed.

In short:  Superb wine list -- and I don't say that about many places.  Attentive service.  Excellent food, with some seasonal items on the menu.

My girlfriend and I ate here before heading to a performance at the Folger Theater about a block away and would recommend this spot to anyone seeing a play at the Folger.

The food, to begin with, is delicious, if solidly conventional.  What really sets Sonoma apart is its wine list and its expert staff.  If you're having dinner, skip ordering a glass of wine.  Instead, have your waiter bring you tasting-size glasses of wines to match each course.  At $9-15 for a glass versus $5.50-9 for a tasting glass, it will only cost you a few more dollars, and the knowledgeable staff will bring you a wine that makes the food really sing.

The atmosphere is also great.  The exposed brick, lounge-style seating, and great space all contribute to a fantastic spot for dinner, people-watching, or just an after-work drink.  I will make it a point to be back for a happy hour at some point.  As far as people-watching, the place is frequented by young professionals, Hill staffers, and occasionally Members of Congress.

I've been to Sonoma twice and will most certainly return. The first thing that impresses me is the atmosphere. The exterior of the building is quite unassuming, which I like, but it is unremarkable...Plain. Ordinary. The interior is a pleasant surprise. It is simple, elegant, and welcoming. As soon as I was inside, I felt myself relax and breathe just a little deeper. The aroma from the kitchen is pervasive and heavenly. It envelops patrons immediately, and the exposed brick walls provide warmth and coziness to the space. The lighting is lovely and low, with candles flickering on the concrete bar and each table. 

I sought Sonoma out, in part, because it bills itself as a wine bar. I was not disappointed. The wine list is expansive and impressive. Sonoma offers almost every varietal by the glass, and the by the glass selection includes some really nice bottles that would only be sold that way -- by the bottle -- at most restaurants. 

The food is equally impressive. The first items I noticed on the menu were the side dishes. Sonoma offers both chard and kale, two foods I love but don't see that often on a menu. The chard is grilled and the kale is sautéed with balsamic vinegar. After checking with the server to ensure that the side dishes we were considering were vegetarian, my date and I chose the kale, a side of field peas with farm herbs, and a margherita pizza. The kale is probably the best I've ever eaten. It is sautéed with golden raisins, pine nuts, and caramelized onions, in a bit of balsamic and olive oil. My companion had never eaten kale and now claims it is one of his favorite foods. The field peas with farm herbs are very flavorful and hearty -- I believe they probably have a touch of liquid smoke in them. The pizza crust is thin and crispy, and the house-made mozzarella is delicious. We had hoped to have dessert, but the portions are very generous and we just didn't have room for it after dinner and a bottle of wine. I opted for a nice glass of port for dessert instead. On my second visit, I sat at the bar for dinner and ordered the same two side dishes. I finished the kale but ate less than half of the field peas, and not because they weren't tasty. Like I said, the portions are very generous. Given the portion sizes, the prices are quite reasonable.

The down side: some of the patrons. Sonoma's proximity to the Capitol ensures that it has more than its fair share of pretentious pricks (male and female) on any given night. Just listening to the pompous pratts ramble on about their own importance while dining at the bar earlier this week made me a little nauseous. However, the food and the wine are worth it. I didn't deduct any stars from my rating because the hosts and servers at Sonoma are friendly and competent. It isn't their fault that the place is frequented by assholes.

The first thing that caught my eye on the menu was that all items are sustainable and organic. This claim is prominent in SF, where I currently reside, so I felt right at home. 

Appropriately named after wine country, I requested a wine similar to a Malbec. The host recommended the Lacrima Di Morro D'Alba. I googled the wine when I got back home and found out that Lacrima di Morro d'Alba is a tiny wine appellation in the Marche region of Italy. I highly recommend this wine! 

For a starter, we shared the baked macaroni and cheese and per the waiter's suggestion, I ordered the burger with gruyere cheese and mushrooms for my entree. I'm always hesitant of ordering a burger at a nice restaurant, but the waiter praised it so profusely that my friend almost reconsidered ordering the hanger steak.

We really enjoyed ourselves, the place is warm and inviting, the service good and most important-the food is excellent. We had a short window for our meal, and we were able to enjoy every sip & bite partly due to the mindful waitstaff and of course b/c the food was just so fresh and well-prepared. We started with some wine (as other reviewers have pointed out, there are plenty of by-the-glass offerings) and then John started with the Eastern Market salad, followed by the burger. I enjoyed the mushroom ragu-over polenta. Really yummy and so filling! I am a big mushroom fan, and the ragu at Sonoma was one of the best mushroom dishes I've had in awhile. Something I'd order again in a heartbeat. Well, of course we saved room for dessert! I let John order & not surprisingly he picked the most decadent of them all-the nutella sundae -complete w/cocoa nibs & chocolate covered bacon. Firstly I am mostly vegetarian & secondly I was already stuffed from my entree. Told myself I'd have 2 bites, but somehow kept digging my spoon into the glass for more. It was that good. For those of you who sometimes find that your eyes are bigger than your stomach, beware this sundae! I left feeling rather overstuffed. Yet very happy.

You will not be saving any money, either.  It's fairly pricey, but worth every penny.  Their selections of cheese and charcuterie are excellent -- and come in generous portions.  The menu is well done.  You can go for something like a pizza, which they do pretty well, or a full meal.  You won't be disappointed by your dinner, and the menu rotates regularly.

The meatball I believe was served with some kind of bechamel based sauce it had a thick, custardy consistency went well with the balls! It was a great to start the dinner. At first the idea of swiss chard with prosciutto sounded great but the swiss chard was on the dry side and the prosciutto pretty much disappeared into the dish. Least fav dish of the night. Now, I am going to give most of the credit to the chef that made the pasta. The lamb ragu with parpadelle is quite fantastic. The pasta is made fresh, cooked to a PERFECT al dente! Nothing quite like a tasty plate of pasta. This reminded me why I love Italian food. The gnocchi with turnips and bacon - the first thought was this is got to be bland and boring. The gnocchi had a nice proportion of potato to flour - giving it a right consistency. The thick cut bacon was cooked to a nice crunch - it's more like a small piece of pork with fat browned than a smokey piece of bacon if you know what I mean. The turnips slices were cooked till tender. This combination was simply out of this world - it's simple yet complex. I was speechless. I had a glass of full bodied Roloson Cabernet of the Russian Valley from CA. It was complex, robust and delicious! The only thing that offset the experience was this party next to me - 17 yr old girls celebrating birthday. The noise generated by them filled the entire restaurant. However, I will be back for more.

I recommend starting off with a nice glass of wine paired with a cheese plate (they have some yummy goat cheeses!).

We're not accustomed to making reservations when we stay on the Hill, but in this case I strongly recommend them (202-544-8088).

Sonoma is probably the nicest restaurant on the House side of the Hill and it has prices to prove it.  Prices range from $13 for burger (a very nice burger) to over $30 for a steak.   It is owned by the same partners that own Tryst in Adams Morgan.  They bill themselves as casual,  yet upscale, which is pretty accurate.

Sonoma has an airy, contemporary feel to it.  Big windows in front with exposed brick and aluminum chairs around the tables. Nice.

The food has been very good each time we have visited.  They use ""naturally-raised"" and organic ingredients for all their meals.  Some of best selections that we have had are the warm duck rillettes appetizer ($9), roasted mix beats ($11), sweet potato puree (a side-- $4), brussels sprouts (which were the best brussels sprouts I've ever had-- $6), NY strip with homemade steak sauce (cooked to perfection--as it should be for the price of $33) and the scallops ($23).  A friend we dined with had the ""dry aged"" beef burger ($13).  He said it was good, but not as good as the Tune Inn burger for $6, which you can enjoy just down the street.   Back to the brussels sprouts for second.  I hate brussels sprouts.  My wife; however, for some reason, loves them.  She forced me to try one.  I must say they were as good as a sprout can be.  She liked them so much that she had the chef come out and tell her his secret.  Turns out it's all in the balsamic vinegar--they use some balsamic vinegar that has to be special ordered.  And you thought all balsamic vinegar was same--no way--not at Sonoma.  The chef brought out a bottle for her to take home.

Huge wine selection as might guess by the name of the place.  They have wine tastings every Thursday night from 5:30 till 7:30 for a cost of $20.  Each Thursday they spotlight a different region or vineyard.  Never have been because I don't drink, but it sounds like a good deal.

They also have take-out available--call 202-333-2602.

We ordered a bottle of the Yorkville sauvignon blanc, which paired nicely with our meals.  We started with the cheese plate (the rogue river blue and the sheep dante were both excellent; the pipe dreams chevre was a little disappointing), which came with bread for spreading and tasty dollops of various chutneys, preserves, and compotes.  For the main course, she had the grilled wahoo, which was perfectly cooked and had great flavor.  The real star of the meal, I think, was my pork.  I didn't even know pork could be this tender - it literally flaked off with a fork.  It was perfect, absolutely delicious, served over a bed of polenta and seasoned wilted greens.  For dessert I had the panna cotta with raspberry jam, which added a nice flavor kick to the otherwise bland panna cotta.  I don't recall what she ordered but it was some sort of biscuit with thyme ice cream and caramel sauce, I think.  She liked it.

The service was absolutely spot-on.  We had a leisurely meal and didn't feel rushed, and our waitress appeared at the perfect moments for us to order our next course, etc.

My only complaint would be the noise level - it got quite noisy towards the end of our meal.

OMAR was so friendly and upbeat and takes his food preps and preparation very seriously! Loved that. 
My husband couldn't stop talking about how simply fresh and tasty the food was. Speaking of the food, their brunch is nice and tasty as well. Food is fresh, colorful and nicely presented. They also make mimosas by the liter, and not just the standard mimosa- they have a few with a twist. 
Their music playlists are pretty awesome as well. I loved jamming to music of the 90s and songs that I could actually sing versus the random crap that is current. 
Just check this place out. You will not be disappointed. Check them out!

The back bar seems like a different world than the rest of U Street which makes it extra sweet. The bocce is a fun perk if you're with a group of friends. It's a wine bar so they have a ton of options for wines, sangria, and of course cocktails and beers. This is great place for a low-key summer night with some pals. 

I recently came here for brunch for the first time. One thing to note is that their bottomless mimosas deal is only in the dining room and not at the bar. Since I was at the bar, my friend and I decided to get a pitcher for the two of us for the same price of one bottomless mimosa deal and it worked out perfectly. I would definitely recommend making reservations if you're interested in getting a table. For brunch, I chose the PBLT and it was AMAZING and I don't say that lightly. The pork belly was on the softer side versus crispy but it worked with the BLT part. They come with fries, and maybe I'm picky about fries, but they were a little too crispy for me.

I came here in May for my birthday with 3 of my friends and received a wonderful birthday dinner. I wish I remembered our servers name as he was such a delight and gave us impeccable wine recommendations. He had a vast knowledge and spoke passionately about each wine we inquired about. We ended up getting 2 bottles and really enjoyed both of the picks he suggested for us.

I want to say his name was Adam but I would hate to be wrong, whenever I go back i'll try to get it!

We tried the calamari, burrata, 2 of the cheeses, and chilled asparagus soup to start which were all absolutely delicious. The asparagus soup made me skeptical to try but WOW the flavor was on point. We tried one sheep and one goat cheese both of which were savory and paired well with the bread that they brought out. The burrata was absolutely sinful, and was definitely a treat! Even the calamari was fried to perfection and we almost ordered a second plate!

Two of my friends tried the chicken salad sliders and raved about them, while my other friend and I split the artichokes entree which was also very tasty.

The only qualm I had was we all ordered a round of cocktails at the end; my friends that I tried were very well made and satisfying. However, I have a personal interest in mezcal so I tried the Moda Antigua, and I was not a fan. I've worked in a restaurant before that tried to mix Mezcal and Fernet and I was not a fan then, nor was I now. If you do not like bitter cocktails or Fernet I would steer clear of this one. No harm or foul to them, it's just not my personal favorite.

He said that it even bought him more time to serve the others so he was very accommodating. 

While we were waiting, my wife and I ordered a glass of wine and ate the flat bread/pita (don't really know what to call it). Leuca recommended this white wine, Nicolas van der Merwe. Try it!! It's the most refreshing and light wine I've ever tasted. 

During restaurant week, we got three courses: appetizer, entree, and a dessert - all with wine pairing. I had the grilled squid for my appetizer, squid and shrimp spaghetti for my entree, and chocolate for dessert. The shrimp for the pasta was a little too salty for me, but the wine pairings were on point! 

My wife ordered the duck and has been craving it since then. She also ordered the sherbet for dessert and that was fantastic. After dinner, we went to their backyard patio and continued to drink.

The restaurant is small but very cute. The lighting is beautiful and so is the decor. If you're looking for an intimate place to dine, this is it. When I went to the bathroom I got a chance to look at their outdoor patio and i must say it is gorgeous! I can't wait to go back when warmer weather is here. 

On Sundays there is a Flamenco dancer that dances along to live music. She is very talented and it is highly entertaining. The only downside is that it gets a bit loud and it's harder to have conversations while she's dancing but it is completely worth it.

My favorites were the charcuterie and cheese tasting boards, the vino cheddar burger, and their pan con tomate. At the end they brought out a dessert with a candle in it. One of the dessert items had nutella in it!

Vinoteca is a charming, intimate wine bar and restaurant right off U Street.  I've been here on a number of occasions and have consistently enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere.  It's also served as the backdrop for a number of important occasions in my life - the scene of a very important first date, a lovely Valentine's Day dinner, and even my wedding reception.  This is how much I enjoy this place.  

That said, this is not somewhere that should only be reserved for special events.  It's always a good option after a long day at the office, when all I need is a good glass of wine, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention it's also one of my favorite spots for a leisurely weekend brunch with friends.

I've been there twice in the past few months, partially because they had this amazing promotion where in December they gave out these Mystery Cards that you could redeem (unopened) if you returned in January.  SO SMART.  And so worth it -- all of us won big, whether it was $50 gift certificates, bottles of wine, or wine classes.  

Also, they have a nice center table for eight that we used both times -- the place gets pretty loud but being in a circle you can at least bond with the three or four people closest to you at the table.  

And I can't forget the mimosas!  $15 (up from $10, which did seem a little too good to be true) and served in wine glasses (#amazing).  They take it seriously, waiters/waitresses walk around with water pitches filled with mimosas and I never even saw a 1/3 full glass, much less empty.  

Food and service are always solid -- I've gotten almost all their omelettes and enjoyed every single one.  When a table of eight all thinks they ordered something amazing, that's a pretty hefty testimonial.

Mimosas, bacon, french toast, smoked salmon, lox, eggs, mimosas, more mimosas, and two hours later, we're THE loudest table in the restaurant.  And that was only because we were enjoying our food and drink so much that we felt we WERE the only people in the restaurant.

Either it's not available or it's just not great, and it never comes with unlimited mimosas. And then there's Vinoteca which completely breaks the norm. Fabulous breakfast food, unlimited mimosas for just $10, and a coziness that adds to the ambiance.
I made a reservation at the last minute through my Yelp app after remembering a friend of mine brag about how great it was. When we got there though, it was full with a birthday party reservation, so we wound up sitting at the bar.  Not their fault since I made the reservation within an hour of arriving, so I didn't mind much... plus the bar area was very large and we sat at a counter facing the dining room (our backs to the actual bar).  It was a bit busy and the waitresses were a bit rushed, but they were polite and trying their hardest to keep up with all the customers.  I ordered eggs, a side of bacon, and the french toast. A girlfriend of mine who was with me ordered the pancakes.  We tried each other's dishes and there were no complaints whatsoever - DELICIOUS!  I especially liked the hint of lemon... not too much, just a teeny little bit. FAB! The bacon, too, was impressive - smoked and cut a little thick, just like I liked it. With a brunch like this, why go anywhere else? Affordable. Delectable. And Bottomless Mimosas. No reason to stray!

They did have a limited menu for restaurant week, but that was to be expected.  We'd checked out the menu online before making reservations so we already knew it was what we were interested in.  I order the grilled squid and my s.o got the warm beet and red cabbage salad.  Both were excellent.  Our main entrees came out shortly after.  I had the roasted duck with roasted root veggies, while my s.o ordered the bison.  I absolutely loved my dish- the duck was crispy on the outside and tender inside.  It was flavorful on it's own, but there was also a nice steak-type (I can't remember exactly what it was!) sauce with it.  Roasted root veggies are a favorite of mine, so I enjoyed having them with my duck. I sampled a bit of the bison with a horseradish sauce as well.  It was medium rare and perfectly cooked.

3238,Vinoteca,/user_details?userid=m2sfw5ikTGb6qjzKccLc1g,"Review for visit on 3/3/2012:

I had pretty high expectations coming to Vinoteca based on the Yelp reviews. My girlfriend and I had meant to visit this place at least half a dozen times when friends from out of town come to visit and are looking for an eclectic watering hole with a touch of class (and nothing says class more than wine bars). Unfortunately, finding a place to park on a Saturday night on U Street Corridor is more often than not an impossible task, which had forced us to find similarly trendy bars in less crowded neighborhoods thus depriving ourselves and our friends of such a neighborhood gem. To describe the decor would be a fusion of a rustic wine bar, a trendy night club, and a 70s diner feel. Quite eclectic indeed. 

However, on an unseasonably warm Saturday morning we met with our friends for brunch at Vinoteca. I was under the impression that Vinoteca was strictly a wine bar so while I had high expectations on the drink specials (HINT: $10 bottomless mimosas. Need I say more?), my expectations on their brunch selections were a bit more tempered. 

I'm happy to report that my expectations were blown away by our brunch experience. I had the ""Bagel #2"", which was a bagel sandwich containing a scrambled egg, three thick pieces of applewood bacon, and sautéed vidalia onions. Absolutely fantastic! The entree, the side salad, and additional order of home fries would have made for an amazing brunch by itself. Adding bottomless mimosas, good friends, a sunny late morning, lots of laughter, and plans to get together again to the equation made for the PERFECT brunch experience. 

Life was truly enjoyed for the two hours we spent at Vinoteca. I cannot wait to visit again.

My partner and I were deciding upon the countless restaurants available for DC's Winter Restaurant Week. We came to Vinoteca out of chance because Farmers & Fishers was booked all weekend, which was our first choice. But it was the best stroke of luck!! We loved each of our dishes, from the Amuse Brouche's delicious sauce to the Flatbread with grilled eggplant to the juicy, smokey flavor of the Bison Steak to the depth of the wine pairings (an additional $25 per person, but so worth it). And the dessert! We both had the Chocolate Hazelnut Tart which was rich and decadent. And with the honey and apricots, your tastebuds will thank you for this dish. If you're a chocolate lover, you have to try it. 

Our server was great as well. Not once did she let our glasses run empty for long. Close to finishing our wine with one dish, she'd swoop right in to place two new glasses. And right when we had taken our last sip, she'd be right back with our next wine pairing for the next dish. Her exceptional service completed the bewitching food adventure.

All the food was very good.  Unfortunately the chef was too busy to have any desert prepared, so we'll have to be back again!

3346,Vinoteca,/user_details?userid=UqsyUqUzx-XBlBNxR6tR-A,"We loved this place! We were here around 6 on Kentucky Derby night and the energy was great inside. It's got the look of a trendy wine bar without the pretension. They offer wines by the tasting, glass, or bottle and so you can essentially make your own wine flight since tastes are around $3-4. They categorize wine by tannins/finish so I thought that was a really cool touch and very helpful. All the wine we had was excellent here and they have a bunch of wine/glass for $5 during happy hour. 

One thing I would like to note is that most wine bars have a smaller bar area (ie, Proof, Cork) and therefore, if you get there later in the evening all the bar space is taken up and you can only sit at the tables if you are ordering food. Well sometimes you dont WANT to order food, you just want a couple glasses of wine. What I loved about Vinoteca is that their bar area was huge and plentiful so that even if one were to get there at 8pm, they wouldnt be forced into sitting at a table and thus ordering food, so big thumbs up on that. They also have a big selection of happy hour food, most notably the sliders which are available in: bison, salmon, lamb, beef w/ cheddar, pulled pork, and grilled portabella. We were all very impressed with our food. The bartenders were very helpful and down to earth too, they started taking bets on horses (Stately Victor!). I would love to come back here for dinner sometime.

3369,Vinoteca,/user_details?userid=XpTwYO7pkqvML6oDRgkX8Q,"Since my last review, Vinoteca has become my favorite place for happy hour owing to $5 glasses of delicious wine with a plentiful selection and, though not on special, delectable cheese 'flights' (plates of multiple cheeses featuring cow, sheep, and goat-milk based products). Though it may be easy to devote all attention to the wine menu, take some time to explore the small plates on special.

Did I mention that the happy hour lasts 5-7 pm through the weekend? In addition, Vinoteca is on a very short list of my winding down, pre-going home stops on weekends for a nice bottle of wine in a pleasant, crowded but not overwhelming, atmosphere.

The real star of this re-review is Vinoteca's brunch: YUM! With their $10 bottomless, bubbly, real orange juice-featuring mimosas, Vinoteca is hard to beat--especially if you sit at the classy-looking stainless steel bar where the limitless drink price drops to the unbeatable $5. For those less excited about mimosas, there is the choice of bellinis, kir royale, or bloody Mary that are also available in the bottomless format.

Note that if you come during colder months, Vinoteca gets crowded for brunch. On a warm day, though, the option of outdoor seating provides a nice bonus to an already highly positive experience. As for the food, the pleasant variety of standard brunch fare--eggs benedict, omelets (especially with wild mushrooms, which is an ingredient that can be ordered as a side), steak & eggs, waffles--as well as the less traditional choices such as lentil soup (goooood) or bagel & lox, should leave most visitors and repeat guests highly satisfied.

3436,Vinoteca,/user_details?userid=5lOiFvW9f8g8pnkwDBX9_w,"After a day of touring around DC with a friend visiting from out-of-town, I needed a quick drink and decided to pop by Vinoteca.   My quick drink turned into 4 hours, not a minute being anything less than great.

First, the wine.  I started with the Bubble Bath, a flight of sparkling wine- only $13, and definitely a heavy pour.  My next wine was a white from South Africa, whose name escapes me.  Apparently Vinoteca is the only wine bar in the U.S. to carry that particular wine, which makes for a great story if not such a great wine.  I moved on to chardonnay, and tried one good glass for $11 and one amazing glass for $27.  I don't usually spend that much on a single glass of wine, but it was so worth it.   I finished out the night with a Pinot Noir and was very pleased.

Next, food.  I tried the sheep cheese flight- with prosciutto, fig and marmalade- and it was awesome.  The pairings were perfect, and the portions were much larger than I had expected.  

The bar itself was fun- very good, diverse crowd, and a great amount of space at the bar.  There was a jazz duo playing when we came in, making for a very chill experience. 

Lastly, the service.  I have never had better service in DC, hands down.  From the moment we walked in, the staff was so accomodating.  The regular bartender was not in, so the general manager and the owner split the bartending duties, which was lucky for us.  Anytime I had a question about a wine, they had not only an answer but also a recommendation and a taste for me.  I must have tried about 10 wines last night, aside from the ones I actually ordered.  One of the servers was hanging out at the bar at one point, and also provided some recommendations and then offered me some of her wine to try it out.  

I was completely blown away by Vinoteca.  From the owner behind the bar to the waitress sitting next to me, everyone there really wants the customer to like the experience, and they really believe in what they are doing.  It sounds simple, but it makes for a happier and more relaxed atmosphere and makes the customer feel appreciated.

Along with enthousiastic service in a moden atmosphere playing classic rock tunes we couldn't help but hum along too, everything we ate and drank was impressive. We both took a tasting of random wines and chose the $30 price fixed option (5-7 pm), which along with any soup/salad, any entree & a fixed dessert, gives you a mini cheese course to really put the deal over the top in value. 

My squash soup with bread pudding and cream was decadent. My boyfriend's citrus arugula salad was tangy and well-balanced. I really liked my steak tartare - though it may have been a little heavy and creamier then I expected. His bison steak was perfect, and paired with the most interesting fried potato patties I'd ever seen - light & fluffy yet savory. The cheeses were great, along with our wine tastes (I love restaurants that let you have a little of many different wines!!). Finally, the generic dessert was anything but. This morning, thinking about that warm apple strudel served with cream made me wish I had had it again for breakfast.

The restaurant had sent a text earlier in the day as part of our reservation asking if we wanted to sit inside or outside. We chose inside as it was a hot and humid afternoon, but as we walked up to the restaurant that evening when things cooled down, we regretted that decision as the outside dinner area was really nice--and already full of happy patrons.

The interior is a cool vibe that I'll dub industrial rustic chic. The wood-fired oven in the far corner was already humming. 

We started our meal off with the local tomato salad with burrata, micro basil, and a light drizzle of balsamic. The burrata was rich and creamy, while the tomatoes tasted like slices 

My parents both got the brisket, which they claimed was tender, tasty, and didn't even need a knife to cut. It had corn and tomato on top, which had a slight kick to it, and small potatoes on the side that also got my parents' seal of approval as they pretty much cleaned their plates in under ten minutes. My mom's portion had too much fat on it, but the waiter was very gracious about it and said he'd relay that back to the chef.

I got a vegetarian entree, the stuffed freekah and lentil poblano peppers with smoky tomato sauce and crema. Understandably, the peppers were a little spicey, but the drizzle of crema, feta, and a bit of cubed avocado helped calm my mouth down. The smoky tomato sauce was yummy and unique--I started wondering what other amazing dishes one could pair it with.

For dessert, my dad and I both got the bourbon cherry cobbler with vanilla gelato, which came out to the table in a skillet. We each got our own, and good thing that we did, because there was not a morsel left. It was a very rustic crust, which added a chewy texture to the creamy, rapidly melting scoop of gelato. My mom had the white chocolate mousse, which sat in a chocolate shell that was later dismantled (okay, devoured), and sat on a bed of fudge with small dollops of whipped cream.

The portions of everything were just the right size, and I was pleasantly surprised that the bill was just under $150 for three alcoholic drinks, a starter, three mains, three desserts, and a coffee. Will definitely be back and will make sure to get a table outside next time!

The dates appetizer is delicious -- exactly the right amount of salty and sweet. I also split the lamb flatbread and BBQ chicken flatbread with a friend. Both were great. The crust is the right amount of crunchy and chewy, and the wood-fired oven definitely adds flavor. The lamb flatbread was an interesting mix of flavors (harissa, haloumi, and arugula... like nothing I've had before!), and the chicken one was a great rendition of a classic. I had the creme brûlée for dessert, and it was perfect. Crunchy on top, creamy on the inside, and sweet and delicious throughout.

They had a great wine selection and we both commented on how we could definitely eat basically anything on the menu. We settled on the Chicken BBQ Flatbread, the Charred Carrots, and the Melted P'tit Basque. You can't go wrong with any of the three. The Chicken BBQ flatbread was especially interesting to me-- gouda they used has a really unique almost ranchy flavor to it that I totally loved.

We were downtown and shlepping to petworth seemed a bit much. Plus, I thought to myself, do I really want to go to petworth. Well my snobbiness was soon put in its place.   The location is very nice. Walking in I was immediately impressed by the bar, general layout, and decore. This was done just right. 

The menu was a great fusion of several South American and Caribbean cuisines. Several other reviews try to pigeon hole this establishment into a specific cuisine or country and frankly that is wrong. People really need to stop stereotyping so poorly. 

Anyway, the one complaint I have is that the menu does not label anything gluten free. Fortunately the server worked with me. I had the red snapper whole fish with rice and black beans and plantains. The fish was amazing. Th black beans reminded me of my Cuban roots. The rice was a nice slightly spicy Mexican sort of rice. The plantains were soft and sweet. The fish came with something like a chimichuri sauce and a more garlicky one. 

We also had some yuca. The sauce that came with the yuca was okay, but I used the garlic one from the fish with the yuca. My wife also had the octopus which she very much enjoyed.

I had read many good things about Ruta del Vino and decided to metro there after work last night for dinner.

It is about a five block walk from the metro. But the evening was beautiful and it gave me a chance to appreciate how much Petworth has changed. A very safe walk.

I arrived and was immediately greeted at the stand and given a choice of whether to sit at the bar or at a two top near the open windows. The bar is very large, shaped as a square, and is in the middle of the dining room. I believe I could have eaten there and been equally as comfortable as I was at my table. The restaurant has a large overflow room to the side for when the main dining area fills up. They also have a small outdoor area.

I sat down and had enough time to review the menu before my server arrived. I liked this because in too many places I sit down and my server is on top of me before I can look at the menu. Overall my meal never felt rushed. Another huge plus. 

The cocktail menu has about 10-12 options. The beer selection is limited to two craft Mexican beers. I think the restaurant could add Pacena from Bolivia, but this is a minor quibble. I went with a margarita, and while not served in the traditional margarita glass, it was very good and just the right size. My server asked me if I wanted water with or without carbonation, and that was another nice touch. 

I started off with the grilled Octopus. It was so good I almost ate through the plate! And it was a generous serving too. It came with some type of sauce and some pickled vegetables. This is how Octopus should always be served.

My main dish was the hanger steak with yuca fries. Impeccable both in presentation and in taste. The steak was the just right portion that came with a delicious chimichurri sauce. And the Yuca fries were about 8, all fried to a golden crisp and tasting fresh. They were so good they reminded me of the first time I had Yuca fries in South America. Lots of places don't know how to do Yuca fries justice. Ruta does.

I was ready to wrap up my meal when my server asked if I wanted to look at the desert menu. I had not seen desert options on the main menu so agreed to have a look. I am so glad I did. I saw and had to order their churros served with a spiced chocolate dipping sauce. They did not disappoint. It was a generous serving. My server said he could bring me a box, but while I should have heeded his advice and left one for the next day, this was truly irresistible and I ate them all in one setting.

That long walk I mentioned at the start? i was glad it is there because it allowed me to walk off some of that delicious meal and not feel guilty of eating it all.

If all roads lead to Rome, then likewise all rutas to excellent eating must lead to Ruta del Vino.

Ruta del Vino is a rare exception in a sea of places like that. The food is truly exceptional.

We went here on my husband's recommendation - he used to work with the owner at the Cato Institute, and had heard in his Cato circles about this restaurant opening. We came on a Friday night around 6:30 with both of my parents, and were surprised to find it not very busy. Upon first glance at the menu, we could tell it was very purposefully designed - just big enough that they can cater to different types of palettes, but small enough that you can tell they are focusing on what they are good at. This was a very promising sign.

We ordered the smoked octopus and traditional ceviche to start, and I got a pisco sour. The smoked octopus was out of this world. Even my mom - who normally wouldn't touch calamari with a ten-foot pole - loved it so much that we ordered a second one. The ceviche was also very flavorful and delicious, but the portion was a bit small.

For entrees, my dad ordered the chicken, and my mom, my husband, and I decided to split the parrilla entree for 2. Everything was fantastic. The meat was spiced and cooked perfectly - even my host parents from my time studying abroad in Buenos Aires would have approved. My dad's chicken was equally impressive; very moist and tender. I often regret ordering chicken at restaurants because I leave feeling like I could have made it better myself. This was definitely not one of those instances.

Now that I no longer live in DC, I don't feel bad about contributing to the hype and what promises to be extremely long wait times at Ruta del Vino. My recommendation is to go now before this becomes the Rose's Luxury of Petworth and you have to take off work two hours early in order to get a table for dinner.

My husband and I have been twice now since it has opened and have recommended to everyone we know. The tortas are absolutely delicious and come piled high with very thin cut French fries covered in some sort of delicious spice. The ceviche (we've tried both the ceviche of the day and the rockfish) were tangy, fresh, and not overly complicated-just as ceviche should be, and being able to find a bottle of wine at a restaurant of this caliber under $30 is the perfect compliment. We have thoroughly enjoyed everything we've tried and it has been deemed our new regular place for a dinner out.

In terms of service, I'm happy to report we've had no problems. The server we've had both times has been friendly and fairly attentive which we appreciated.

It is a destination worthy restaurant and/or wine bar.  Come for the food or the wine and you won't be disappointed.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.  It is hip and chic with echoes to South America.  They just opened, so they have a few service kinks to work out (we ordered everything on the appetizer list and it all came out at once-- a little pacing and spacing would have been nice, but that is a minor nit to pick of a new restaurant).  The wine list is creative, approachable and affordable.  The wines are all from South America and they are well described on the list, often with reference to more familiar European counterparts.  I tried three of the reds--one they described as a Urguayan nebbiolo, one they described as South American pinot noir, and another that was a blend of two grapes and now I've forgotten its details.  Maybe I shouldn't have had the third glass of wine!  The folks I was with had a few of the other wines and we all agree that they were well-described and excellent selections.  Another member of our party had a cocktail, too.  She liked it enough to want to go back to try others of their cocktail creations.  So, this place is a great place to go if you just want a glass of wine or a cocktail.  The bar is really comfortable and cozy.  But the food is just as outstanding.  We tried everything on the appetizer menu except the cotija cheese--they were sadly out of that.  We had a kale salad that featured homemade croutons.  It was excellent!  We had some grilled octopus that we considered among the best we had ever tasted.  We had some clams in a white wine and bacon broth.  Delicious!  We tried some cohiba ceviche.  The fish was fresh and clean tasting.  It was kissed with some spicy heat, but not so much as to obscure the quality of the fish.  A great dish.  We had an arepa with some house pickled vegetables.  Another hit.  We had some fish tacos.  The fish was battered and fried.  You could tell it was a nice piece of fresh fish and it was fried delicately without becoming oily or greasy.  A super minor nit to pick with this dish:  the tortilla probably should have been a little bigger.  The tortilla didn't quite engulf the generous pieces of fish.  Like I said, I a really minor nit.  And we had some empanadas.  As good as I have had in a long, long time.  And I love a good empanada!  For dessert (yes, there were only three of us, and yes we ate all of that food, and yes we ordered dessert--don't judge us--the food was that good!), we ordered the churros.  The chocolate dipping sauce that came with the churros was really great.  It tasted like a Mexican chocolate dipping sauce.  It was bittersweet, not treacly sweet like we typically get around here.  And the churros were good, but they were the least good part of the meal.  They could have been left in the fryer about 30 seconds longer.  They were slightly under-fried.  But this spot has only been open a week.  The kinks were all minor and eminently workable.  The wine list is terrific. The food was outstanding.  The prices reasonable.  And the service was extremely pleasant if a bit on the uneven side.  But again--it's brand new. We're eager to go back to try some of the entrees.  If you live in Petworth this should definitely become your new ""go-to"" spot.  If you live anywhere in the DMV, you should put Ruta del Vino at the top of your list for cool, affordable wine bars and/or great South American cuisine!  This place is a definite hit.

The avocado toasts were perfect. It is such a simple dish but I loved every bite. I think they also serve this as part of HH menu. 

The other dishes were also tasty. The only think that was lacking were the french fries. I've had them before at HH and they were tasty but at brunch they were overcooked...too crunchy outside with no potato goodness inside.

Seated in the back right next to the kitchen was absolutely fine and remained cozy despite additional noise and light vs the rest of the place.  The service was friendly and very attentive and my water glass was never empty.  

Here's the order...

A bottle of Spanish red wine, a blend with a label reading ""Luna"", was ordered at $38.  It was an absolutely incredible wine.  

Next came a cheese plate, meat plate, and olives...All amazing.  
Cheese highlight was likely the Humboldt Fog and the accompaniments and bread.  
The meats were all phenominal...Proscuitto, Soppressata, Duck Salami, and Speck were all unbelievably fresh and delicious.  

To top all of this off, the price for it all was relatively inexpensive.  

My one and only beef...Not seating a partial party.  I understand the rationale behind that but when you have 4 of 5 people there and you want to get started on the wine, why not just seat us at the same table you'd seat us at if we were all there?

And one of the most unique deserts I've tried:  Ginger Caramel Pot de Crème. There's more there than the names suggests - I can usually tell what's in a dish on taste alone, but this left me pleasantly puzzled.

We were able to get a great table next to the kitchen here this past weekend without a reservation-- perhaps Cork has just been around long enough now that it's an established presence without the crazy hype that surrounds other restaurants of its caliber making it impossible or simply inconvenient to get a seat on short notice. The vibe during my meal was low-key enough that we could focus on the excellent food and varied wine list, and watching the tiny but efficient kitchen operate, and learning some of the tricks of the trade in the process, was a pleasure.

I won't comment further on the established favorites here (the avocado toasts, the chicken liver pate)-- but all the dishes we tried (many of them seasonal)-- deep-fried squash blossoms, heirloom tomato salad, soft-shell crab BLT-- were all spot-on. I ordered the heirloom tomato salad worried that it might be similar to something I could create at home, but the elegant garlic vinaigrette, just-tart-enough blue cheese, and top-notch meaty tomatoes proved me delightedly wrong. The only minor disappointment may have been a smoked goat dish that was stingy on the meat, which was not as flavorful as I would have liked, and very uniform in texture, with a pool of pulled meat sitting atop a mushy if delicious round of polenta.

The service was excellent, and the dishes came out at a swift but manageable pace-- perhaps most importantly, this is a small plates establishment that actually understands that small plates need to be equal parts exciting, shareable, and satisfying-- not once did I scratch my head wondering how one was expected to split what was presented to us on a dish.

Cork is a great standby with memorable dishes and exciting wines for a reasonable cost, and I look forward to the next of hopefully many visits.

3809,Cork Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=uwt8VZMQX_rHqCLfPdrQXA,"I could start and finish this review by quoting my friend who told our waitress at the end of our meal, ""I LOVED everything we ordered!""  That summation perfectly encapsulates our evening.  There wasn't one dish I wouldn't highly recommend and the two bottles of wine we ordered (a chenin blanc and a cotes du rhone) perfectly accompanied our food.  

This was only my second time at Cork, the first being last summer when four of us had a late night dinner and sat outside for another memorable meal.  We only ended up at Cork because our first choice last evening--Estadio--wouldn't take reservations for parties smaller than 6.  Consequently their 45 to 75 minute wait for a table was out of the question.  Cork, which normally plays the role of uber-popular restaurant where you must wait for a table under all circumstances had just a five minute wait.  We'd barely taken off our coats by the time our table was ready.

Because everything was so fantastically, slap your mama delicious, it's an injustice to talk about just a few of the dishes at the expense of the others.  The merely delicious won't make the cut, but half of the dishes were a revelation including 
1) bruschetta of anchovies and roasted red peppers--not overly salty or oily, these anchovies tasted fresh and citrusy
2) chicken liver pate with shallot marmalade--buttery and rich pate perfectly matched by the sweetness of the marmalade
3) duck confit on a bed of spaghetti squash--the night's special was served to look like a chop.  How the skin could be so crispy when the flesh was falling off the bone is a delicious mystery that I don't want solved
4) chickpeas and spinach in a saffron scented broth--we all need more saffron in our lives
5) grilled fontina and prosciutto brioche sandwich with a sunny side up egg.  Enough said.

I realize Cork is one of those places that is so popular it can become a victim of its success.  Lord knows I loathe having to wait to eat when I'm starving (you can always call ahead and put your name on their list), but last night I felt like we got seated like rock stars; the service was top-notch; and the food, wine, lively atmosphere, and of course the company of our good friends just made the evening one of my most favorites recently.  I can't wait to go back and see if Cork always keeps it buzzing along at level eleven.  We shall see.

I sat next to the olives at the bar, which was a tight fit but necessary due to the height of my heels that night, and I was impressed when a bartender rearranged the bar to make his reach less convenient but my personal space at the bar more plentiful.

The night started off pretty poorly as the server spilled an entire tray of red wine flights down my back, ruining my clothes. Hey, it happens. It was a completely honest mistake, and while I wasn't happy about it, I understood.

The server apologized repeatedly, then the manager came over and apologized again. He also whipped out some WineAway and tried to spray the stain out. (It didn't work.) 

They comped my wine flight, gave us a major discount on an incredible bottle of St. Emilion Bordeaux, and brought out about 4 extra plates of food for us, on the house. The service was spectacular the rest of the night.

As we were leaving, the manager gave me his business card with his email and phone number and asked me to send him my dry cleaning bill. As it turned out, the dry cleaners could not get the wine stain out of my shirt without ruining it. I told this to the manager via email, and he called me and said Cork would not only be covering the cost of the failed dry cleaning, but would also be paying for a brand new Brooks Brothers shirt for me to replace the one that was ruined. 

The food and wine at Cork is great enough to warrant a visit even if the service sucked. But after this experience, I can say the service is phenomenal. The place just happens to have the best staff on the planet.

3885,Cork Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=lZO-oUhEumH0fAd2Mkfn7A,"We love this place. I don't normally like small plates, but here, many of the items are so good, they transcend all expectations. Even the bread has us asking the vendor's name. A lot of the dishes are mediocre: ask for recommendations! Mostly, though, we come for the outstanding service and selection of wine. Who can say enough? The choices are many, the advice is excellent. If the price seems high, you can cross the street the next day to buy a bottle at the Cork shop for very reasonable costs.  I'd say too that the by-the-glass list does not match the quality and value of the bottles. It's almost certainly worth buying a bottle, and finding one to suit, and the perfect price-point, is easy with Cork's servers. 

I have to remark that wine list is hard to use (three overarching categories with lots of overlap, no pagination, and no real ""front page"".) Worst, they're selling bottles of wine that do not match the years printed on the list. That seriously needs to be fixed, or some accommodation made. We've noticed this week after week, and the answer (this fall, 2012) has been ""New wine lists are being printed,"" but not even a sliver of recognition that anything is wrong with misleading the public. Fortunately, the 2009 Burgundies that are replacing the 2008s tend to be better, so that's cool. But please, staff: say that in advance, not while you're pouring the wine and we're jumping out of our seats at the misunderstanding. Okay. That's done. 

What makes up for that oversight is that the wines in any category will be about the best, and the best value you'll find outside of France. (Yes, it's chiefly French and Italian here, which is fine by us.) It's easy to spend three hours and not to much money here. It's even easier to swing by the next day to buy up bottles across the street. A fine operation!

Other quibbles, here and too many wine bars: 

1) Yes, give each diner a menu, but since it's a WINE BAR, how about giving a wine list to everyone, too? 

2) Should scented soap be in the restrooms of places that purport to encourage the smelling and tasting of wine? Fix this and you'll help your patrons enjoy what they're at Cork to enjoy.

We got there and the place was packed so we squeezed in at the bar. While waiting for some friends, we ordered a glass of Pierre Gauthier, Bourgeuil, ""Soif du Jour"" 06, Cabernet Franc, from Loire and a Nero D'Avola that isn't showing on their menu right now. Either way, after tasting both, we went with a bottle of the Cab Franc, good, dry, jammy tho and full. Loved it.
We also started snacking there, while still waiting for our friend. Ended up having the following before we were even moved to a table(thanks Mugsy!)
House-Cured Trout, shaved fennel, toasted hazelnuts, tangerine vinaigrette -nice and light with a hint of fennel. Clean flavors
Roasted Brussel Sprouts, pancetta, brown butter, thyme - This was my absolute fav, the brown butter caramelized them just right, and the pancetta wasn't over powering
French Fries  tossed with parsley, garlic, lemon, house-made ketchup - the house made ketchup was one of the best parts, almost like a chutney, but not as chunky. Perfectly season with finger licking goodness
House-Marinated Olives - the usual. nothing to write home about.
   
Once we made it to a table, the server suggested a really great red by the bottle that was like 44 bucks. I dint remember his name or the name of the wine, but it was perfect for what came next. 
Rosemary Chicken Liver Bruschetta, shallot marmalade, herb salad  
Roasted Brussel Sprouts, pancetta, brown butter, thyme  (AGAIN!)
Grilled Angus Flat Iron Steak, rapini, braised raddichio, horseradish sauce - get it cooked med rare, so good
Sautéed kale, garlic and pecorino  - cooked well enough that they kale wasn't bitter anymore and melted in with big huge chunks or pecorino. 
For desert we had the cheese plate, which had an Oregon Fog(my fav), a manchego, a funky blue, a cowgirl creamery cream(also delish-WHATS UP SF!), and another one that I cant quite recall. Chased down with a redbreast whiskey, Grahams 10 year Tawny(a little sweet for my blood), Warre's OTIMA 20 Year Tawny, and I think a Ron Zacapa Centenario, 23 Anos. Yeah, we can drink.

Overall, good prices, excellent service, good food. I like that they serve hard alcohol for those not into wine, but I do wish they served wine that wasn't just from the old world. It's limiting. Besides, only a very small percentage of people really know wine and will recall that wine again. But if its local or from the US, it'll make people feel less ostracized. Don't be so pretentious. Just saying.

In my experience, even with a wait, the bar spots tend to open up with some frequency.  Sundays and Tuesdays are great if you need to sit down right away.

I love that the wine list actually has a focus and Cork accomplishes it well.  It's ambitious enough to represent the hundreds if not thousands of varietals produced in the Old World and I appreciate that I am always trying something new there instead of the same random smattering of global big names I'm seeing everywhere else.  Even better, because of this focus, the servers are incredibly well versed in the selection and happy to help.  Why mourn Argentine Malbec when your server can recommend a more nuanced Cahors for you to try? (from the same grape.. who knew?)

Above all though, I come back for the food.  The small plates are perfect for sharing, which means you get to try a lot more than at a coursed dinner.  For me, it's always a toss up between the avocado or the oil cured tomato and goat cheese bruschetta - both simple and perfect, the kind of things I'd love to try at home but fear just wouldn't be the same... The roast leeks are rich and savory and set off with the creamiest burrata I've ever tried.  The dark horse is the brioche sandwich with prosciutto, fontina, and a sunny side egg, indescribably good.  I wake up craving that dish.

Maybe not quite. But it's getting there. I came to Cork on a recent Saturday fully and patiently expecting to wait a long while for a place to stand, and maybe if I was lucky and the stars were aligned in my favor, a table at which to sit.

Well! As soon as our party of three was complete, we would be seated! While waiting for the straggler, two of us snagged seats at the intimate bar, where we immediately made friends with Barry (who, by the by, I am convinced was *actually* Ira Glass under cover. Glasses, and all. He gave us a narrative, ""This American Life""-style rundown of the menu, obvi, that was quite useful. Thanks, Barry cough Ira). The bartender was literally at our service, friendly and helpful.

As for the table service, our waitress was adorable and friendly. I loved that we could order as we liked, allowing us to properly evaluate our hunger/desire to eat more delicious appetizery-dishes. Calamari was some of the best I have ever had. I would further recommend the roma tomato bruschetta, the lamb, and the cookie platter for dessert.

As for the wine, Cork's alleged main purpose for being: order a flight, thereby expanding your quality wine knowledge without blowing your entire stimulus check in one evening. (A flight is three 2 oz. servings of wine that goes well together).

The first time I ate at Cork my party waited almost two hours. The place was absolutely packed, but the hostess/owner did everything she could for us, including sending over free drinks. The staff was really apologetic and friendly, and the food was so incredible that it was never a question whether I would come back. Now I've eaten at Cork a dozen times. The brioche is one of my favorite dishes in the world (seriously, we're talking ""last meal"" contender). The avocado with pistachio oil and the chicken liver are other standouts, and the goat cheesecake will ruin all other cheesecakes for you, even if you don't normally like goat cheese. Also, compared to other small plate places I've been, the dishes are generously sized and actually good for sharing. 

Every waiter I've had has been attentive but not too obtrusive. They also strike a nice balance of being really helpful with the wine selection without coming off as intimidating or snobby--just very enthusiastic about wine, and proud of their selection.

I give the mussels and french fried 5 stars. I can't get enough of their shoestring fries. They are always hot crispy and delicious. 

The grilled cheese is at a 3 for me. I really love the bread and buttery taste, but the cheese combo isn't quite up my alley. 

The mac and cheese gets a 3 as well. It is hot and cheesy and looks delicious. I just wish the flavor profile was a little more deep. I think the recipe relies too much on the diversity of cheeses used, but the flavor is lacking for me.

This is not your typical get drunk Glover Park bar and is a ideal place to have a drink and some dinner by yourself without being hassled or pushed around because it's so crowded.  It definitely reminds me of New York or even a Paris bistro where the locals never leave.

If you want a cool local bar with great wine where you can relax and escape from the local Glover Park drunk scene, read a book by yourself, or actually hear and enjoy the conversation of the people you're eating with while drinking really great and reasonably priced wine - go to Slate.

I bought a gilt city coupon for Slate when they opened and my boyfriend and I went to redeem it just before the holidays.  We enjoyed a cheese plate, a bottle of really great wine, and two entrees.  I agree with the other reviewers that the food is not Michel Richard's Central but if you don't want bar food it definitely beats a greasy burger from Town Hall or a bowl of mac and cheese from Bourbon and the prices are comparable.  My ratatouille was fresh and delicious and my boyfriend had a special for the evening that he loved.

We had been thinking about moving out of the neighborhood that we have loved for 5 years because we were afraid we had outgrown Glover but our experience at Slate completely changed our attitude.

Based on a first try on opening weekend, not only is the wine list really diverse and cool, but the food is pretty amazing as well.  There are only about a dozen tables downstairs and a bar downstairs and upstairs. We made reservations on Saturday night and were worried when we walked in because it was crowded, but we were pleased to see an empty table waiting for us. The hostess is super cool and from the neighborhood and the owner checked on us several times to make sure we were enjoying our food and wine (we were enjoying both!)

The Wine:  The wine list is really well rounded with wines from around the world. Slate seems to have much better wine by the glass choices than most wine bars in DC and they have an extensive list of bottles  I counted four or five glasses that were less than $13 a glass and the most expensive glass was about $17. I LOVE Pinot Noirs from Oregon and there were several to choose from (our server told us the wine list would frequently change so I won't mention specific wines - but they all seemed great!). The bar itself is very cool with the wine, not the liquor being showcased.   They have liquor, but it seems to be hidden behind the bar.  estaurants. 

The Food:  The food is VERY good (better than I was expecting!) and the menu is cool for several reasons.  First, there are plenty of main courses but also a choice of snacks (almonds, wasabi peas, edamame, etc) in case you just want to nibble. We didn't sample the Cheeses, but they looked great.   The salads are huge and tasty.  

The Ambiance: Slate has a cool, chic, urban yet relaxing feel that is unlike anything else in Glover Park. Everything from the signs out front, to the comfy bar stools with backs (I love being able to lean back in a bar stool!) to the nice colors to the marble bar and cool wine fridges behind the bar ad to the comfortable feel.  The restaurant that was in here less than two months ago was dirty and run down. I almost don't believe it is the same space!

Getting in: When I first popped in on Friday night it was crowded, but they do take reservations. I imagine it will be MUCH easier to get in on a weekday.

A friend and I made a last minute decision to go out after a long day of work, and after eating, we were happy with our decision. 

I ordered a simple buenos white wine to start, and was pleased at the low cost, but savory taste. It had a light grapefruit taste to it, and left a flowery taste on the palette. Definitely a refreshing wine to have before a heavier meal. That said- I ordered the chicken skewers, which came with tortillas. The flavoring on the chicken was on point, and definitely something I will try to mimic in my own kitchen. I also ordered a side of rice, one of my simple favorites, and what was given was enough to feed a village. Kidding- but it was a large portion. My friend ended up eating a good amount of it as well. He ordered some domestic beer to start, and the steak and mushroom plate for dinner. The steak and mushroom plate came in a cream sauce, with french fries on the side. He enjoyed his plate as well. 

Not only was the food delicious, but the ambience of the restaurant was lovely as well. The lighting was set to mood, and it was relatively quiet. Surprisingly the restaurant was also pretty bare with people. Im not sure if it is just not a popular Friday night spot, or if its too far to the Northern side of DC, but people are missing out! The only change / suggestion I would have for Philos was the choice of music. They were playing pop / EDM out of the early 2000's which was kind of weird for the restaurant. I would have preferred some slow, instrumental Spanish music, but to each his own!

But today I experienced something that I can only describe as akin to what the Marcel Proust described in his masterpiece In Search of Lost Time. Proust described how his main character has a wave of involuntary memory after eating a Madeleine cake dipped in tea.  For me it was the perfect bite of pecan pie with rich black coffee.  Sitting outside in among the golden yellow leaves falling in the evening the sweet crunch of the candied pecans. 

Trust me when I say that normally I am a cold hearted bastard and far from sentimental, but  there was something about the desserts at Philos. The first bite of their pecan pie with ice cream made me want to scream at providence and the universe for letting me forget simple pleasures. The second bite with a sip of coffee made me want to dance in an endless waltz with this city. A second sip of coffee and spoonful of the ice cream taught me how to laugh again at the ridiculous nature of the human experience. 

Philos is a neighborhood joint it is a place to have that second bottle of wine, to sit in the middle of a crowded city, to celebrate being human, to lament the passing of the seasons, and rejoice in meeting new people.  

My advice is, if weather permits and even if it is a bit nippy, sit outside. Don't rush or try to force it, Philos will cast a spell on you. The food is even on the worst nights decent, the service is bewitching, that perfect mix of friendliness yet reserve that you can only find in the Gion district of Kyoto. Take your time Philos is of the old world, you have to visit at least three times before the spell is cast.  Also if you want a bit of kick get the Turkish Coffee. Don't worry about going alone, it will be that place where you don't mind being alone.  

As I write this review I keep wondering why I am not smelling burnt toast, the rational part of me knows that I have had some kind of stroke. Yet, the only thing I can find odd about myself is that I still have a faint smile and my steps feel a bit lighter...then again a few glasses of wine may do that to you, but hell if drinking and eating at Philos makes me happy enough said, another glass of wine it is!

Here is the gist: The food and service are absolutely amazing. Small plates. Lots of options. Reasonably priced. Our new place. Here is the play-by-play:

3:35 p.m. We show up to eat, are seated right away and then find out that they serve brunch until 4 p.m. We decide to walk around and come back until we can order off the dinner menu which was what drew us to Philos in the first place.

4:00 p.m. We try to pick a table. More challenging than you might expect since they use cinder blocks to hold up their umbrellas so some chairs can't be pushed out. Not prob for me, but the boyfriend has long legs.

4:02 p.m. We pick a table and sit. The seats are definitely too low for the tables, which would make a business meeting awkward, but no issues for us.

4:03 p.m. Our waitress comes over. Very friendly and helpful! So far: Service 10, Seating situation: 6 (minus points for awkward cinder block and wacky chairs on funky slant. Plus for awesome patio and beautiful sunlight.)

4:20 p.m. First round of food arrives. We got a three cheese plate and the spread sampler with hummus, Greek yogurt and feta spread. All absolutely delicious and very generous cheese portions. Waitress, again, an absolute pleasure. Her name is Melissa, ask for her.Food: 10, Service: 10, Fig jam: 10

4:31 p.m. Delightful waitress stops by again. Service: 10. Everything has been so fabulous the seating issue is negated.

4:36 p.m. Mussels arrive.
4:36:30 p.m. Mussels are devoured. Absolutely delicious.

4:37 p.m. Scallops arrive. Un-freakin'-believable. Food: 10.

4:41 p.m. Grilled calamari arrives. Perfect. Food: 10

Now it's 4:46 p.m. and our amazing waitress checked back in, asked what our favorite dishes were and is bringing us the check. We love it here and will come back at least once a month, I am sure of it. We'll sit in these wacky chairs any day.

There have been a few times where some items were not always up to par with their normal standard, but the staff is very good at addressing any concerns.  In fact, many times they will bring us a tapa to try on the house.

It is also a nice change to have restaurant that tends to cater to a more adult crowd. I love Deluxe, Cactus and the other restaurants in the neighborhood, but they can be overcrowded with large families. Barcelona of course welcomes all, but it seems to attract more adults than families.

He found this place on Yelp, and, wanting to venture outside our comfort zone, we entered in in Maps and hiked off to find it. I'll tell ya, if you have never had this kind of food, you MUST try it! I would highly recommend their 11 course menu. It's all small tapas style (single bites, or maybe 2-3) of their many favorites from the larger menu. We also added the Turkish wine pairings to enhance the experience; he ordered the red, and I the white. He truly thought he would be hungry by the end, but, actually, we were both fully satiated, and could not eat another bite. 

Ok, now to the flavors galore: we loved the zucchini thing (kind of like a fritter). We also loved the chicken dish. Honestly everything was delicious, but these two stood out. By the time the baklava came... ooooh, the baklava..... So good.... We were in a euphoric food coma. As for the wines, they were actually quite tasty. Not being familiar with Turkish wines, we did not know what to expect. Worth giving it a go, for sure. 

Finally, the service. Our server was very kind, and took her time explaining how we should order, what we should order (more importantly, what we were eating), and was extremely attentive, despite a full dining room. The ambiance was cozy; a tad loud for normal conversation, but not enough to deter you from a romantic evening. Seriously, this is on my MUST DO list next time I am in DC!

We decided to go with the prefixe menu which literally lets you try 11 plates (or something ridiculous like that) - which we were able to sub meat dishes and make it all vegetarian since not all of us are meateaters.

We were so full and happy at the end of that lunch. The food quality, service, and portions were great. We had so much food we couldn't even finish it all and by the time dessert came we were forcing it because who can say not to dessert? Anyway, the price was reasonable, I believe it was about $35 a person and we were fed some amazing Turkish food. 

I've been eyeing it to go back but haven't had the chance yet. I'm surprised there were not more people there during lunch, I'm wondering if maybe its because of the time of day or just that its tucked away on P Street plus you couldn't really tell it was open.

Realize, this is Turkish food. So it's a mix of the Middle East with some Greek and Mediterranean mixed in. It's absolutely amazing when you take that into consideration. If you're looking for a grease pit with large portions to stuff your face, go elsewhere. This is for people that actually enjoy good food and tasting fresh ingredients from another part of the world.

One thing I will say for the wait staff...

We had an incredibly rude family come in who sounded like they were from New York or something...followed by a decent sized party of students or something who were equally as rude. They yelled, were demanding, didn't understand the menu (even though there's an English one on the backside) and we're just pricks altogether. The wait staff was PHENOMENAL!!

My boyfriend and I chose to celebrate our third year anniversary at Ezme.  We arranged it in the last minute and all of their tables were booked during dinner time.  I thought it was unfortunate that we had to settle for early dinner.  However, it was also a good sign that people love this restaurant.   

Atmosphere: At the moment we walked in, I was impressed by the authentic wall designs and ceramics.  They look so good and it feels like you are in one of the elite restaurants in Istanbul.  Plus the music was excellent.  It was modern Turkish music from 60s, 70s and 80s at that night.  The music definitely added up on the romantic lay out of the restaurant.  

Food & Service: It was just perfect.  Everything that we ate was excellent and very close to the ones that my boyfriend and I tasted in Turkey.  In the beginning they bring a very delicious and crispy Turkish bread (Pide).  At the moment I got my first bite, I knew that it will be an amazing dinner. They serve tapas plates and I recommend that you order 4-5 plates for 2 people.  They have a great wine selection including some Turkish wine.  We tasted a Turkish wine and loved it!  Also service was fast and they make sure that you have clean plates once they serve new food, so that the tastes of different dishes won't mix with each other.  

In addition, once we told them that we are celebrating our 3rd year anniversary, they brought champagne and they made this very cool plate for desert which has ""Happy Third Year Anniversary, February 2015"" written on.  

Overall, my experience was great!  Although a large group of young people came in and sat very close to our table, we didn't have any issues about noise.  I think it was because the way that the restaurant was set up.  So it's a great place for both large group meals with friends and a date meal.  Strongly recommended!

Cons: restaurant was noisy/crowded by the end our meal, the Turkish beer (Ezme Pilsner) was average at best

My husband and I ate at Ezme last night (Friday). We had 6:30 reservations and were seated promptly on arrival. The dining room is small, but well appointed. The tables are very close together but that seems to be the case with ALL DuPont circle restaurants we have tried over the years. The decor and ambience was appealing. We were a little dubious of a ""Turkish Tapas"" restaurant and how long our dinner experience would be with eleven courses. Our total experience took a little over an hour.

Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly. She explained the premise well and answered our questions satisfactorily. We chose to do the eleven course tasting menu. For those unfamiliar with ""tapas"" style dining, our choice meant my husband and I would have eleven dishes EACH to try. Each plate has a dish that is about 2-3 bites per item. I should also mention with the eleven course dinner choice, you don't get decide which bites to try. The items are all described on the menu.

Our dinner began with bread and hummus which was not included in our eleven courses. When our courses began arriving, we were impressed. The presentation of each dish was visually pleasing. Our waitress also offered a brief description of each course. 

The food and service were GREAT. I'm a moderately picky eater (I NEVER eat seafood) and I really liked each course, even the smoked salmon!! When my husband and I had finished our portion our dishes were whisked away and a new course was quickly delivered. Each hot dish arrived piping hot. There was not a course we did not like. We DID notice that the eleven courses contained a high ratio of meat dishes. We were VERY full by the end of the meal!! 

Overall, our experience awesome. Excellent food, great service, and a ""different"" dining experience makes Ezme a restauarant we would DEFINITELY recommend to friends and that we are very likely to visit again. The only ""downside"" was the restaurant got very busy and noisy around 7:30. Luckily we were finishing up by then.  If you prefer a more intimate dining experience I would strongly suggest making reservations no later than 6:30. 

I should also mention the prices were very reasonable. The eleven course menu was $35 per person. It was a lot of food for the money. The cost per person is considered average for the area.

The taste outweighs all other similar plates.

One additional benefit they offer is their complimentary surprises such as serving new experimental dishes candidate to enter menu. It happened twice to me, once with a new soup and once with Doner Kebap.

I ordered a flight of three Turkish and Italian red wine selections ($17), all of which were excellent. Then I ordered the $35 tasting menu, which includes five courses of your choice. At each course, we tasted each other's selections and debated which one was better--they were all so good! Among my selections were a red pepper spread with pita, a salad with feta cheese, fruit, and pistachios, some cheese-filled flutes of phyllo dough, and a plate of lamb and veal (which I normally avoid but couldn't resist trying). Each of these courses was the perfect size and wonderfully seasoned. The last of the five courses was a dessert choice. At the server's suggestion, I tried the semolina with vanilla ice cream. The description does not do it justice. It was such a unique and complex dessert. I've never had anything like it.

Ezme has an extensive food menu. The food is served tapas- style, so sharing is cool.  Luckily, my dining companion is a vegetarian, and she was willing to help me try as much on the menu as possible. our server, Tufan, was extremely attentive, helpful, and pleasant.

Muhammara (roasted peppers, onions, walnuts, olive oil, garlic)- This spread was PERFECT with the warm bread that was on the table. Actually, this spread was great with the asparagus. 
Mercimek corbasi (red lentil soup)- Nice flavors and the serving was perfect. Yummy
Dolma (stuffed grape leaves)- The rice and spice were nicely cooked together, and the dolma has a nice pickled taste. Nice!
Yesil beyaz (Asparagus in lemon and olive oil, feta, and roasted peppers)- The asparagus was steamed to perfection in the olive oil and lemon. The perfect compliment  were the feta and roasted peppers. The party in my mouth was in full gear
Sigara Boregi (cigar- shaped pastry stuffed with feta cheese, dill, and parsley)- It was so damn good! 
Sebze Kabab- (Grilled mushrooms, zucchinis, green pepper, red pepper and tomatoes on a skewer, served with humus) PERFECTLY grilled. I didn't even use the hummus because I didn't want to take away the flavor or the veggies. 

This is truly a wine bar, and the wine choices are extensive. There are flights of the month which allows a person to try 3 different wines in 3oz glasses. I order the white Angora which was perfect for the blazing hot summer day.

4600,Ezme Restaurant & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=N0JoLtf3qZX45jzhndh92g,"I really enjoyed both of my visits to this restaurant.

Two things to note: 
1. I am very familiar with and adore Turkish cuisine.
2. I have a small appetite.

The food is authentic Turkish food, which just sends me over the moon. It is hard to find sometimes, and I was thrilled. There are also plenty of options to pick from, which can be a little overwhelming. I like it because, combined with the smaller portions, it allows you to try so many different dishes. I think that's fantastic for people who are unfamiliar with Turkish food. 

The small portion sizes are absolutely perfect to me. They also have a few (three-ish?) entree sized meal portions, which are appropriate for people who have a larger appetite.

Whenever I have gone, we ordered two appetizers and each person picks an ""entree style"" meze option. Then, we sample from each other's plates. It works pretty well for us! I usually finish off by ordering the baklava, which is a pretty good sized piece cut into four sections, so it is perfect for a group of four. =) 

The post-dinner cay (black tea) is so comforting, but do note that it has some caffeinated punch to it. I am not a fan of coffee, so I can't comment on the Turkish coffee.

The wine selection is quite large, and the huge swath of options can be overwhelming. I think that is probably where many people end up spending more money at this restaurant, because it is easy to choose a high end wine without realizing it. 

It is toward the expensive side, but I did not think it was overly so. It is quiet, nobody rushes you, service is fantastic and everyone is very sweet and very excited to share Turkish food and hospitality with you. I have left stuffed and satisfied every time. I would prefer to pay more for a better ambiance, environment and experience than to pay little and have a headache or be annoyed by screaming children the whole time I'm there.

The mucver (zucchini pancakes) were great, though I cannot possibly describe their flavor - not at all like zucchini.  The Hellim peynir (cypriot cheese) was really cool.  The texture was unlike any cheese I've had before - sort of chewy, which seems odd -- chewy cheese?  But it was very good.  Somon Kebap (salmon kabob) was terrific - the salmon was surprisingly fresh and not at all overcooked, and there was a sauce described as spinach puree which was delicious (and not particularly spinachy).  The Kulbast, or maybe a different lamb dish, can't recall exactly which, was fantastic.   The only thing I wouldn't recommend was the green beans (not on the regular menu) - not bad, but cooked a bit more than I'd prefer.  Everything else was delicious - we over-ate because everything was so good, and turned down desert.  The owner (I assume), who had stopped by a few times during the meal (sign of a good restaurant!), brought us over this fantastic take on a baklava to try - no, not really baklava.  *Way* lighter, with a bit of flakey crust, nuts (pistach?)  and cheese.

Mercimek kofte: the parsley flavor trumps the taste of the fresh lentils
Ispanak salatasi: delicious spinach salad with light dressing; perfect to offset the heart meat dishes.

I also tried two of the lamb dishes and they were both great.  one of them was special, meant to be shared by two.  I finished off the meal with a cup of turkish coffee and baklava - sweet and simple.

Then recently, she got another chance to drag me kicking and screaming here after another Yelp-related event... and I'm so glad her kung fu was greater than my kung fu!

We coaxed Justin C. to come out with us, and he snapped pics of his food as we dove into ours... unwittingly making disturbingly sexual noises as we tried everything on our sampler plates.  This was real food.  This was real Turkish food.  This was real, fantastic, bright and flavorful Turkish food.

As Áine F. described in her review, I had the vegetarian sampler with the wine pairing.  Our server was just oozing charm and he was very knowledgeable about the menu, the chefs, and Turkish cuisine in general.

Weekend in DC with Mom, bro and bestie for the Cherry Blossoms and in need of nourishment. Cue unassuming Ezme with a tiny ""we're open"" sign on the door. Walking in we were faced with walls of wine (note to self: decorate walls with wine for my house? Hmm) and a small but inviting bar and dining area. We were seated by a window and you could see the colors change as it turned from evening to dusk. Since I have painted such a lovely picture for you, imagine an overly perky waitress with a need to over pronounce everything, but you know she means well. Oh my God get me wine. Choose a nice and reasonably priced Rioja. She informs us that they only have the reserve of that year, same price is that OK? Ehm, well If I HAAAAVEEE TOOOOO.  

The food is tapas style so we are encouraged to order 3 plates each. Here is a breakdown of the choices:

Babaganush- creamy, smoky, and could have been eaten with a spoon without its delicious homemade bread. 
Patican Ezme- the least favorite, but I'm not a huge eggplant fan. 
Mercimek Kofte- delicious. I was surprised they were cold but the flavor was unbelievable. I'm not a huge fan of yogurt sauce but it complemented the spices perfectly. 
Dolma- I could have made love to this dish. 
Sigara Boregi- that's feta cigars to you bub. Cheesy, melty, salty, exquisite.
Somon Kanepe- Mediterranean answer to lox and cream cheese. 
Somon Kebap- inviting, comforting.
Donor Kebab- my brothers favorite food in the world 
Manti- the favorite meal of the table. Turkish comfort food. 

If I could eat here every night, I wouldn't get bored for a very long time. It's fresh, its brought to the table one serving at a time which gives you a few moments to savor exactly what's in front of you as well as pick off everyone else's plates. Also, I find when everything comes out at once you're not quite sure what is what, especially with a foreign meal. You want to know exactly which dish if the one you ordered and does it taste exactly as described. The food was so good, that in the middle of the second and third course we ordered a bottle of Turkish red. Although I enjoyed the Rijoa better, the wine had great acidity and a fruity body. Very drinkable.

I believe this place will become a regular rotation when I'm down in DC in June. I suggest eating there before word gets out and you can no longer get a reservation!

4645,Ezme Restaurant & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=Zb-dZ3FOL_MzcXFsLtMTZA,"Even though they just opened about a month and a half ago, I'm already such a big fan of this restaurant that I had to hesitate for a little while before writing this because part of me wants to selfishly keep it as a secret, but I know that whether I write this or not it's going to become very well-known very soon so I may as well help the cause.  Ezme is from the same people who own Meze, and the tapas-style menu is pretty much the same.  At Ezme, however, they have a great location at Dupont that's hid away just enough to keep it truly authentic and let it maintain its ambiance.  It's perfect for some situations if you're looking for something slightly more low-key and quiet, as it's not too big and you feel very comfortable immediately, but it definitely packs up on weekend nights. 

All of the food is DELICIOUS and very well-priced for the portion sizes - but you should plan on getting at least 2-3 plates each and sharing for the best experience. The wine selection is impressive with its size and variety, and the bottles also contribute to the decoration by making up an entire wall inside. In my times there, I've had three different bottles and they've all been perfectly matched with whatever you order and well worth the price (which I feel is actually quite fair).  Desserts are also delicious and very presentable, especially the baklava! 

All of the servers and staff are incredibly gracious and kind, and they have perfected the difficult task of balancing giving you enough time with also being very attentive and at hand whenever you need something, have a question, etc. They're great at explaining what everything is, because even as someone who loves the variety of Turkish food that they serve it's hard for me to actually visualize what's going to show up in front of me without getting some insights and recommendations from the menu. 

Overall, great food, great wine, great price, great staff, and I'm going to miss being able to just walk in or get an easy reservation in the near future once the word really gets out about Ezme.

4689,Ezme Restaurant & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=1j8V3oLKEFyxJWVrr8Os1g,"4 1/2 stars for Ezme.  Short story: excellent Turkish ""tapas"" (small plates), great wine selection, and romantic ambience makes for a great dining experience for this weary traveler.   If you're a local, I'd recommend coming in on a date with your sweetheart, or with a good gang of friends up for sharing items for the expansive menu.

Here's the full story: I came in to Ezme on a whim while on a business trip to Washington. Checked Yelp at my hotel and found a good looking Italian place at 21st and P and walked over, but spotted this place next door and was intrigued by the prospect of Turkish fare (not something I get to eat often).  What I found was excellent: all three small plates were delicious, wine selection was good (and my choice tasty), and ambience was great.

About the food: the place does ""Turkish tapas,"" so small plates great for sharing or nibbling several in a meal.  I was unfortunately dining alone (like I said, business trip) but I ordered three plates: 

-a delicious well-spiced red pepper spread (can't recall the name, started with an 'M') was first up, paired with good, still-warm bread, which also came with olive oil and balsamic for dipping -- and slaking any early hunger pains while you wait.

-their fried calamari, which was superb!  Some of the best I've had.  Lightly breaded with a tangy, salty spice and excellent balance of chewy and tender.  Served with a nice aoli-style home-made tartar.

-finished with the salmon kabobs.  Came out with two skewers of delectable bite-sized pieces of grilled salmon. Nicely spiced with a bit of salt and peppery, grilled flavor.  Served with a pesto-like sauce and a small dollop of great garlicky mashed potatoes.

The place is also an excellent wire bar for the vino-philes out there.  Lots of options from across the world (California, Oregon, Washington, France, Italy, Turkey, Spain, Greece, and more).  

All told, very good experience and quite pleased to have stumbled in.  Only thing I regret was that I wasn't there with my sweetheart -- or a big group of friends suitable for lots of sharing. The ambience was nice and romantic, with low lighting and warm wood interior themes creating a nice comfortable scene.

Don't miss this gem if you are in DC, especially if you can make it for the jazz night prix fixe or happy hour (half off glasses of wine)!

-----

I had the three course jazz night prix fixe.  At $39, it's a great deal!

APPETIZERS:
The tarte a l'oignon was delicious, with long tangled strands of onion and just the right amount of bacon to balance out the sweetness.  I think there may have been an egg in there to stabilize everything, making it almost like a less custardy quiche lorraine.  As much as I enjoyed it, the onion tart was a little heavy and greasy for the beginning of a 3 course meal, but it would be great for sharing as a snack with drinks.  For once in my life, I almost would have preferred a smaller portion size!

The chicken and foie gras mousse terrine was great.  I also enjoyed the (boneless!) pied de cochon with a crispy crust and mustardy greens on the side.

ENTREES:
The paillasson au saumon (salmon in a potato crust) was amazing.  Both the salmon and the surrounding potato crust were perfectly cooked, not an easy feat!  The best part was that every element on the plate was perfectly seasoned; even the bed of tomatoes and spinach wasn't an afterthought. 

The beef medallions are absolutely worthy of all the praise they've been getting.  The beef was tender, and the Gruyere polenta was delicious.  I hate when vegetables are ignored at a restaurant, and again that was not the case here: the sautée of beets, carrots, zucchini, and other seasonal vegetables was tasty. 

I also tasted the veal kidneys in mustard sauce, which were a little tough and not to my taste, but certainly an interesting offering.  

DESSERT:
The chocolate mousse was not as rich as I was expecting, and had an odd sort of powdered sugar flavor to it?  The stewed peaches at the bottom of the dish didn't really go with the mousse.  If you're craving chocolate, I'd recommend the warm chocolate tart instead.  It comes with a little pitcher of creme anglaise on the side!  The creme brûlée was also delicious--very rich and solid with a slight lemony flavor to it.

SERVICE:
You may have to specially request to see the prix fixe menu, which is offered on Mondays and Wednesdays.  The pacing of the meal was a bit slow--the 3 courses took 2.5 hours--but it was nice not to feel rushed.  Our waitress was extremely accommodating and polite.  The back area of the wine bar was both intimate and elegant.  I was sad to leave!

From even the reservation phone call, I knew that Bistrot Lepic was going to be a special experience. And I am very pleased to have celebrated there.

Everything I had heard about Lepic was positive word of mouth, but I don't know what I expected upon making the reservation. The restaurant downstairs was smaller and more intimate than I had imagined. In the place of the bucolic archways littered with dusty chalkboards that I had imagined were murals of French art, such as Caillebotte's Paris Street; Rainy Day accenting warm marigold walls. A variety of stemware hung above the service bar, which held exceptional French wines. The tables were spaced tightly to accommodate twenty years of happy patrons.

We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant, with champagne flutes waiting to celebrate with us. We split a bottle of Crémant du Jura Blanc Brut--a blend of Chardonnay and Savagnin [a varietal more similar to Gewürztraminer than Sauvignon Blanc]--which was from a French region largely unfamiliar to us. It was the first day of Restaurant Week [August 2015], and Lepic was bustling. We shared the cheese plate while looking through the menu. The cheese plate offered a Camembert and two other cheeses. One, either an Abodance or Comté, was our favorite, both nutty and semi-firm. Fresh apples and dark grapes served as companions to our cheeses, and a whipped blend of crème fraîche, confectioner's sugar, and cinnamon was a fantastic accompaniment.

The restaurant week menu offers a large proportion of the regular dining menu. We ordered the escargots and beet and apple salad to start, with the salmon and trout entrées. The apple and yellow beet salad was delicious and the herbed goat cheese played well with the tartness. The escargots, served in garlic butter and basil, were exquisite. We ordered a bottle of the 2011 Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Château Banneret with our entrées at the recommendation of the restaurant's manager, whose hands-on oversight the dining room made us feel taken care of. The salmon was served with a wafer-thin crust of julienne scalloped potatoes and the paired tomatoes offered a bit of acid to refresh the palate. The trout was served with brown butter over a purée of celery root. Couched in simplicity, these traditional offerings were fine representations of the best of French cuisine.

For dessert we shared the crème brûlée and the toasted meringue over vanilla anglaise before finishing our wine upstairs at the jazz bar. We had just missed the live music, but the ambiance upstairs was completely different--while just as welcoming--as the bistro downstairs. The two spaces share the love of late-1800s Impressionism, with Van Gogh's Café Terrace at Night on the wall along the staircase. The warm yellows downstairs followed us upstairs and became accented with lush reds on curtains and seat cushions. The crowd was beginning to trickle out the door with the jazz set complete, and we toasted our remaining libations at a coffee table in the center of the room. Finally, with our stomachs full and faces ruddy, we took our leave on a blissful anniversary.

You would think that being the major foodies that we are we would have satisfied this distinct craving, but nooooo....we just kept wishing to find a good French restaurant. I mentioned this when I saw the listing for DC Winter Restaurant Week 2016 to one of my coworkers and she told me about this amazing little spot in Georgetown. I made a reservation before even asking my hubby and it was a GREAT decision. Parking was actually decent on the street so that was a good sign despite the fact that it was in the crazy busy Georgetown. Walking in you get that comfy ""mom & pop"" feeling with the cozy ambiance. Downstairs is the actual restaurant and upstairs is the wine bar. We were seated at a table for two and greeted with warm french bread. I am not one to actual eat much bread but the rolls and butter was really warm and yummy. I ordered a glass of champagne (duh...when eating French drink French too!) and the escargot au beurre d'ail (snails baked in garlic butter) to start. Hubby ordered the Tarte a l'oignon (Onion tart with bacon and baby green salad). Both very good choices. I now what to buy the dish to make escargot and have already pinned French onion tart recipes to make at home! For dinner Hubby got the Medaillons de boeuf poelles (beef medaillons with Gruyere polenta and wild mushroom rosemary jus). He thoroughly enjoyed it. He said the meat was very tender and simply melted in your mouth. I took a bite and have to agree...it was delightful! I ordered the Poulet de Cornouailles (Breast of cornish hen with curry sauce and sesame fried leg with squash gratin and saffron almond currant rice). It was mouth watering. The sesame fried leg was something out of a gourmet French grandma cookbook I swear. It was that good. I do not know how to even mimic that at home. Who could have thought cornish hen could make me so excited to eat! The saffron almond rice was a nice accent to the meat. For dessert hubby got the Mousse au chocolat With fresh seasonal fruit & Chantilly and I got the most amazing Ile flottante (Baked egg whites floating on a crème Anglaise), also a recommendation from my friend. My dessert was so light, fluffy and decadent. What an amazing meal. I cannot express how delicious everything was. My husband and I definitely will be return customers. Next time we want to check out the wine bar upstairs.We made sure to peek in before we left...very trendy with small low tables and couches as well as regular seating and the bar. Nice!

It was one of the tastiest meals in DC for me in a long time.

-The tarte a l'oignon--""ooli caou"".

-The beef medaillons with wild 'shrooms and some other incredible vegetables in a rosemary jus, alongside creamy polenta with gruyere--""eett waz krese goud"".

-The pear pastry--""yor mo-seur"".

This place has got just enough of the ""haute"" in its haute cuisine to be dazzling. Meaning, Bistrot Lepic goes right up to the line, but doesn't cross it, both in its Gallic atmosphere and in its cooking mad chops.

Crisp, professional service. 

Many patrons dine here. Make reservations; this establishment will honor them and turn folks away to protect yours, so, s'il vous plait, do not NOT show up.

My favorite spot is the wine bar upstairs, a cozy space with a bar at the back and low tables for dining stretching to the front of the space. A couple of nights a week you're treated to various jazz acts for free, playing in a space with great acoustics that heighten the dining experience.

You can't go wrong with the classics on offer. The onion tart is an old favorite, as are the chilled soups that often grace the gradually-evolving menu. The cheese and charcuterie platters are often perfect for a light meal. My favorite entrees are the tender, hearty beef medallions and the innovative curried-chicken and rice. Both are delicious accompaniments to the real star here: the wine.

As a red drinker, I'll often seek recourse to the house bordeaux/languedoc. If they've got the Chateau Paul Mas in, definitely try a glass. My other favorites are the Chateau de Malleret, the Baron de Malleret, and the newly-featured Haut Bana, a subtle, structured blend of just enough tartness rounded off to delicately pique--but not overwhelm--the palate. The Dumont et Fils champagne is also nicely balanced between sweet and dry; great for the hot DC summers.

The desserts are heavenly, but my choice is often a last glass of wine. Bring that special someone or a small group of friends; you'll be glad you discovered this little oasis.

I really appreciate that the basics are done really well here- the house salad has the most perfect mustardy bright vinaigrette.

I like the trout or the beef medallions, and this summer I had the salade aux fruits de mer- I'm still thinking about it, two months later, it was that good.

I met and fell instantly in love with Monsieur Bistrot Lepic almost two years ago, yes it was love at first sight/taste and it is still going on strong.  

The bartender is very knowledgable about his wine and gives numerous generous tasters before you commit to a glass, bottle, cocktail.  

As a side note: Tuesday night is wine tasting night.

Lepic treated me like any chivalrous gentleman should - attentive, considerate, gave me anything I wanted.  Our relationship continued to strengthen as I return over and over again, I'm treated like a royalty.  Jay (wait staff and friend) knows my usual starting drink and knows that I always start off the night with an order of escargot.  It comes hot and dripping with flavor - tons of garlic and basil.  It would be cruel to kiss anybody after a single bite.  It is without a doubt, the best escargot available (endorsed by ppl who have been to France).

Another appetizer that I would recommend is the salmon tartare.  It is prepared ""oriental style"" with sesame oil and seaweed, a wonderful mix of textures and flavor.  Oh please, do not get your panties up in a wad over my ""oriental"" comment.  I'm Asian, I'm not offended.

Recommendation for main dish??  For our first date (between me and Lepic), I asked Jay to surprise me with the best dish on the menu and he brought out the veal cheeks.  Great flavor, melt in your mouth tender.  Since then I introduced my love to many many friends and dates (real men, not restaurants).  Even my food snob best friend that I adore from CA (sigh home) dreams and drools over this dish and demanded the recipe as soon as she heard whiff of it being available. The recipe is featured in a local cookbook (a collaboration of different restaurants in the DMV area in support of breast cancer).

Cute, great ambience.
Wonderful staff who knows you by face (and eventually name).

Cozy informal atmosphere in a very pretty setting. Food was generally excellent while not being overly fussy. Portion sizes were good for the price. The onion tart appetizer was about the best I've ever had. Salmon main course was very good especially with the thin crispy latke- like crust and excellent sauce. Creme brûlée was just OK-could have been more creamy. The wine list was medium in length and had a very nice variety of mainly French wines, with reasonable markups (for the US, where wine markups are generally ridiculous compared to those in other countries). Service was generally good-sometimes had to wait awhile for things to come, but who cares when you're relaxing in a nice place listening to music. Sometimes had to hail waiters to come over, but there were several waiters circulating around and they were pleasant and helpful. The only downside was that the tables were kind of low for eating so you had to be careful eating, but the upside of that is you eat more slowly and don't get heartburn.

It honestly doesn't look like much from the outside, and the garish blue and yellow awning offends my design-snob sensibilities. But I made a reservation for dinner last night after a glowing recommendation from a friend, specifying that I wanted a table in the upstairs room (the wine lounge). 

All I can say is... WOW.

The interior is beautiful -- very Parisian cafe. The upstairs lounge is host to a mishmash of wicker furniture and low wooden tables, and the walls are covered in Van Gogh murals. Dim lighting, cushy pillows everywhere... fantastic ambience. 

The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and recommended a delightfully complex Bordeaux blend (the Chateau Mondesir-Gazin Blaye) that my boyfriend and I loved. We split one of the appetizer specials -- calamari stuffed with garlic -- and we were both impressed. However, it wasn't until my entree arrived that I was truly floored.

I ordered the braised veal cheeks, osso-bucco style and served on a bed of round pasta. HOLY BUTTERY BOWL OF GOODNESS. The veal was so unbelievably tender that it fell apart when I nudged it with my fork, and the sauce that it was served in was so rich it would have made Paula Dean faint. I think I growled at my boyfriend when he asked if he could try a bite. It was one of the best dishes I've ever had. My boyfriend had a similar (if less religous) experience with his roasted lamb, which was perfectly cooked medium-rare and served with a yummy smoky serving of ratatouille. We both practically licked our plates clean. My waiter had to wrestle the plate away from me at the end of the meal because I just didn't want to let it go. 

After that, we decided to split a creme brulee, which was just okay. The top tasted pretty burnt, like blackened marshmallows, and the cream underneath was fairly bland. Underwhelming compared to the rest of the meal -- I would recommend trying a different dessert. 

Even despite the mediocre dessert, I'm giving this place five stars. Get the veal cheeks. You'll think you've seen God.

First of all, the atmosphere and decor of this place is intoxicating.  Every one looked so jovial and beautiful.  We took the waiter's wine recommendation and two glasses were sitting before us in no time.  The restaurant was buzzing with business, but we felt completely taken care of.  I find that rare in this city of mediocre food, overpriced menus and lacking service.  We started with the the la terrine de betterave et fromage de chêvre or beet and farm goat cheese terrine with balsamic dressing.  Good God.  I was so satisfied with that yummy combination that I almost forgot we still had the médaillons de boeuf, polenta et jus aux shitaki or beef medaillons with polenta and shiitake mushroom sauce coming.

4871,Bistrot Lepic & Wine Bar,/user_details?userid=yae9PNffX7BNoiNEuDOcOg,"I wrote the first review almost 3 years ago, but I want to give an update after my experience on Friday.

I was trying to plan (rather last minute) a birthday dinner for myself and a few friends.  I had been to Bistrot Lepic a couple of times before, and I knew that I preferred the wine bar upstairs to the restaurant itself (better lighting, more distinctive scenery).  I emailed BL to see if I could reserve the private wine room.  Cyrille (managing partner) emailed back to say that the wine room had been reserved, but they could set up a long table for 10-12 by the windows in the wine bar.  That was perfect fo rme, so I made the reservation.  

By the time we actually went to the restaurant, my party had grown from 12 to 14.  They had set up the table for 10, but had set up another table for 4 completely separate from the others.  I didn't have to argue much to get the waitor (I don't remember his name, but he was taller, short light hair and very French) to do some shuffling.  In about 2 seconds, they had completely re-arranged the tables to accommodate 14 people.  It was tight, but it was exactly what we wanted, and they did it without complaint.  

Once we actually sat down to eat, the service was pretty remarkable (for a party of 14).  The server did a great job of getting all the orders correct, and in a timely manner.  He tried really hard to get everything right, and it paid off.

The food is great.  I had the rockfish, which was expertly cooked.  We shared the sauteed foie gras, which was amazing.  We had a few vegetarians in the group, and they had the veggie plate (5ish sides of whatever vegetables they are serving that day) and they liked it.  The desserts were the big hit, with creme brulee and the chocolate mousse getting rave reviews.  

The drinks are another reason I love the wine bar.  They offer wines by the half or full glass, and i absolutely recommend that you order the half.  Their ""half glass"" is comparable to most restaurants'  ""full glass.""  If you want to try more than one wine (which you should!), this is the way to go.  Some of the non-wine drinkers ordered cocktails, which cost twice as much, and were tasty, if a bit sweet.  

The bill came to $600, with tip included for 14 people.  Not bad considering everyone ordered at least 1-2 drinks, appetizers, entrees and a few desserts.  

All in all, I will continue to use Bistrot Lepic as my go-to restaurant for special dinners and events.  I'll try to plan a little better next time.

Each month has a new theme to the wine list which I think is super cool.  I went during ""Anything but Pinot Grigio"" month showcasing some of Italy's lesser-known whites.  
I recommend talking to your sommelier and let them surprise you with some recommendations.  Our sommelier, Daniel, did an excellent job getting in our heads, honing in on our palate, and pouring a different wine for each person in our group that was excellent.

There are many somms & soon-to-be-somms found here-- folks that will greet you with a smile, happily offer recommendations, but are far more concerned with what wine is the right fit for you. In June/July, white wines from around the world (new & old) are on feature (Anything But Pinot Grigio is the theme; Staff are rocking some mean ABPG shirts styled à la ACDC)-- but there are bubbles, whites & reds, as well as beers & cocktails, to meet all needs. In August, gear up for a bubbly feature. And while Maxwell similarly rotates its chefs, this month's dishes/tapas are not to be missed. We shared the duck prosciutto & smoked trout. They were so perfect to pair with the wines as we sat out on the uncrowded patio and watched people with their dogs stroll by. This is a welcome addition to the neighborhood & I know we will be back to support Maxwell soon. Between the service, the array of quality wines, and the thoughtful plates, it's hard to settle for anything less.

After reading a bit about the concept, and getting recommendations from my beer-loving friends, I decided to visit. At 530pm on a weeknight, the space felt full. They have a diverse and well-curated selection of wines, and I got excellent suggestions on my glasses from one of the owners, Brent. Friendly service and classy vibe. My only complaint was that the space got extremely loud, so if you're looking for a quiet place to chat, maybe not the right bar. Can't wait to return!

I'm not a big wine person, but was very impressed with the offerings, and totally delighted with the salt peanut infused rum, which I'd travel across the country for. The service was so warm, the vibe so chill - our new favorite bar.
